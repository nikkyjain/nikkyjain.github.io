The causes of influx are the causes of sufferings and therefore these should be given up. Intermingling or union of karmas with the spacepoints of the soul is called bondage (or the Bandh Tattv.) One should never do such bondage. Subsidence of passions and control of the sense organs & mind result in stoppage of the influx of karmas. (This is known as Sanvar Tattv.) It should always be resorted to. (This needs to be practised respectfully.) To shed off the karmas with the help of penance is known as Nirajaraa-Tattav. It should always be practised faithfully.
