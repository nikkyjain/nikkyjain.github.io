(With a view of spiritual development) the stages of Jeev or soul are classified in three states as Bahiraatmaa, Antaraatmaa and Paramaatmaa. One who considers his body and soul as one and the same and is ignorant of the Reality is called the Bahiraatmaa. One who possesses the Right Knowledge is called the Antaraatmaa. The Antaraatmaa is of three kinds Uttam, Madhyam and Jaghany. The Shudhopayogee monks, who are free from internal and external possessions and who are always engrossed in self-mediation are the Uttam Antaraatmaa.
