(In absence of the Right Knowledge) this Jeev has attained the state of the higher positions in the Greveyak limitlessly but it has not been able to attain the Right Knowledge. This rare opportunity of attaining Right Knowledge is attained only by monks within themselves. (Reflection in this manner is Bodhee Durlabh Anuprekshaa.)
