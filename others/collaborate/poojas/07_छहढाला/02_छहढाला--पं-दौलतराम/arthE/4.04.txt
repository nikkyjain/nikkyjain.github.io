All the substances have infinite attributes (Gunn) and also infinite modes (Parjaay). The Omniscient (Kevali Bhagawaan) knows all of them directly and also simultaneously at the same time. In the universe, there is no other cause of spiritual bliss except the Right Knowledge. This Right Knowledge is like supreme nectar, which cures the disease of birth, old age and death.
