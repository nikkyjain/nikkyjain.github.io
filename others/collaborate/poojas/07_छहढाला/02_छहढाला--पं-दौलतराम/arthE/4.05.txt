The Right knower sheds off his karmas in a moment through three Restraints (Trigupti). These karmas shall not be shed off even by performing penance without Right knowledge over millions of births. The Jeev is born in Greveyak (higher heavens) infinite times after having the Great Vows of the monks but without the true Knowledge of own-self, but it could not get even an iota of spiritual bliss.
