Wealth, society, elephants, horses, kingdoms etc. are not useful for the emancipation of soul. Right Knowledge is the intrinsic quality of the soul and once attained remains permanently with the soul. The primary cause in the attainment of omniscience is the Right Knowledge of discrimination between "Self" and "Others". Therefore O Bhavy Jeev! Make crores of effort to attain it and to keep it close to your heart.
