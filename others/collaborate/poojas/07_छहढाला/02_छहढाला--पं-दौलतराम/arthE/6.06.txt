They (monks) take little food from their palms in the standing posture only once in a day. They pull out their hairs of the head, are not afraid of the afflictions and keep themselves engaged in self-meditation. (These are their remaining Seven Virtues.) They always keep equanimity in between friend and foe, palace and cremation ground, gold and glass, criticism and praise, worship with reverence and the attack by a sword. Thus they always remain equanimous in all circumstances.
