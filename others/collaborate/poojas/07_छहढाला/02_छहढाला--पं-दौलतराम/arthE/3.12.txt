Eight limbs of Samygdarshan are now being described. One must have faith without any doubt in the preaching of Bhagawaan Jinendra (it is the first quality of Right Faith). Not to have desire for sensual comforts by following Dharm (is the second quality). Not to feel disgust on seeing the unclean bodies of the monks (is the third quality). To have proper discrimination between the reality and false principles (is the fourth quality). Not to publicize one's merits and others' demerits and to propagate qualities of soul (is the fifth quality). To re-establish one-self and others in the true path when they deviate from (the path of) religion due to passionate feelings like unchastity etc. (is the sixth quality). To have affection with co-religious fellow as the cow keeps affection with its calf (is the seventh quality). To glorify and propagate the religion of Jin (is the eighth quality). Opposite these eight virtues are the eight infirmities, which are to be incessantly destroyed.
