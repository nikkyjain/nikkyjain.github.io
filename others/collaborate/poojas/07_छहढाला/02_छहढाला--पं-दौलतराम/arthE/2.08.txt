With inborn wrong faith and knowledge, the soul conducts his activities with indulgence in sensual pleasures. This is known as the inborn wrong conduct. (agruhit mithyaachaaritra) All these three things are the reason for unhappiness. One has to remove them with the help of understanding the knowledge of truth (tattva gyaan). Without this understanding, one is unable to get rid of desires of the objects of the senses. Even if these are gracious attachments (shubha raaga) or auspicious objects, they are still the objects of the senses and need to be dismissed. The soul who is engrossed in them ends up forgetting his true nature of super sensuous bliss (atindriya aanand).
