A Right Believer is not born in his next incarnations as inhabitant of hell except the first earth (out of seven), as a Jyotis, as a Vyantar and as Bhavanavaasee celestial, as a hermaphrodite, as a female, as an immobile organism and as a Vikalatray Jeev. In all the three parts of universe and in past, present & future time, there is nothing else as bliss-yielding as the Right Faith. This Right Faith is the root of religion (or religious life). All activities in its absence brew suffering.
