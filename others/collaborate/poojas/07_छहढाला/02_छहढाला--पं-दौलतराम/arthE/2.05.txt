The Wrong believer thinks that with the birth of the body he is born, and with the body's demise, he will die. He believes to have favorable or unfavorable modifications occurring within himself when actually the changes occur in the body. This is his misconception regarding the non living element.
The ignorant soul believes that alien substances produce happiness to him and as a result embraces them. He believes the alien substances are the reason for his likes dislikes and deluded state. He does not accept the fact that any alien substances can never give happiness or unhappiness to him.
In fact the belief that one can do the activity of alien substances (kartutva) or to keep the ownership in alien substances (mamatva) is a wrong belief. This produces unhappiness and is the reason for bondage of karma. This is the misconception regarding the inflow element.
