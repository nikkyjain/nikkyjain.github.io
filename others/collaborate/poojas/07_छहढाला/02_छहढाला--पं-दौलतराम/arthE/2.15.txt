The living being, for the benefit of the self, should discard the notion of inborn as well as acquired wrong faith, knowledge and conduct. He must practice the nature of the absolute right faith, knowledge and conduct. Pandit Daulatramji addresses his own soul and says that O my soul' The transmigratory cycle of life and death occurs due to the wrong dependency towards alien substances. So as soon as possible, please give up the notion of auspicious and inauspicious activities and get engrossed in the nature of one's own pure soul.
