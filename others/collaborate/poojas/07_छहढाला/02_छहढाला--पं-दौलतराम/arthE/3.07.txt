That which is without consciousness is called Ajeev-Tattv. It is of five kinds-Pudgal (Matter); Dharm (Medium of motion); Adharm (Medium of rest), Aakaash (Space) and Kaal (Time). Pudgal possesses five colours, five tastes, two odours and eight kinds of touch as its qualities. Dharm Dravy, which is without touch, taste, colour and odour, is helpful in movement of living beings & matter. Adharm Dravy, which is also without touch, taste, colour and odour, is helpful in rest of living beings & matter. All these are preached by Jinendra Bhagawaan.
