The author says that O Bhaaee (Bhavy Jeev) ! You must neither feel pleasure on fruition of meritorious karmas nor weep on fruition of non-meritorious karmas. The fruition of meritorious or non-meritorious karmas is modification of matter (Pudgal), which continues to appear and disappear and can not remain permanent. This is the only essence of the entire discourse. Therefore this must be kept in heart with full faith (firmness), breaking the knots of all conflicts & entanglements of the world and to remain engrossed in the pure nature of one's soul.
