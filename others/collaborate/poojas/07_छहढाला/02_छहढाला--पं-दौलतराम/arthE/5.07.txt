(In the mundane world) the soul and the body are intermingled as water and milk but they are really distinct and have not become one. The wealth, house, son, wife, which are evidently separate, how can these be one with the soul? All these are separate from the nature of the soul. (Reflection in this manner is Anyatva Anuprekshaa.)
