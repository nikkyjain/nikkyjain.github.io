The person does not have proper knowledge of the realities. Therefore he does not understand the true nature of the discriminative science (bhed vigyaan) between the soul and the matter. As a result, he adores the wealth, body, the senses, self fame, respect, pride etc. He performs the activities of mortification of body without the understanding the discriminative knowledge of soul and alien substances. He does all these activities to fulfill his desires. This is known as acquired wrong conduct. (mithyaa chaaritra)
