Pious & wise persons, who cherish Right Faith without any infirmities and with (all eight) qualities are praised by the Lord of Heaven, though they (Right Believers) may not have even small restrained conduct due to fruition of conduct deluding karm. Such Right Believers although remain in their houses (with their families) but do not indulge in them in the same manner as the lotus, though in water, remains different from (untouched from) water, as the transient love of a prostitute and as the gold lying in mud remain free from filth.
