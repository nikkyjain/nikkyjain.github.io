The soul obtains the association or separation of circumstances according to the fruition of non-destructive karma. The wrong believer becomes perplexed (aakultaa) by his likes and dislikes and believes them to be favorable or unfavorable to him. As a result he imagines being happy or unhappy. He becomes happy with acquiring wealth, spouse and family. He becomes unhappy with disease, poverty, and loss of family. Auspicious as well as inauspicious activities are the cause of bondage of karma; instead he believes auspicious activities to be beneficial. In reality the auspicious as well as inauspicious acts are both detrimental to the soul but the wrong believer does not understand this fact. This is the misconception regarding the bondage element.
Right faith, right knowledge and right conduct from the absolute point of view (nischay samyak darshan) are beneficial to the soul. As one gets stabilized within himself, there is a proportionate diminishing state of delusion. The wrong believer perceives them to be the source of suffering to him. This is the misconception regarding the stoppage element.
