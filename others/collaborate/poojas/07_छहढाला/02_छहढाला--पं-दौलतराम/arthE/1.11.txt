Inhabitants of the infernal life fight and chop the bodies of each other into small pieces. They are incited to fight amongst themselves by wicked and fierce celestial beings known as 'Asur kumaar'. They have extreme thirst, which cannot be quenched by the water of an entire ocean. Despite this they do not get even one drop of water to drink.
