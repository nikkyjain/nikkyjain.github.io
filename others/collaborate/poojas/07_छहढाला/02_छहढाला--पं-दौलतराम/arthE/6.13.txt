In the state of salvation, the universe and beyond the universe, attributes and all their modes are reflected in one-self. They (Siddhas) will reside there for an endless period of time in the status of Siddha. Such Jeevas deserve all praise as they could accomplish this task of attaining the supreme status of human-life. Such souls, dissociating from the beginningless worldly wanderings of five types had finally attained the excellent bliss.
