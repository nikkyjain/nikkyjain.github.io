Every so often, the soul took birth as a five-sensed animal without the power of rational thoughts. In this case such a soul would be ignorant about his true nature. Even if an opportunity arose to take birth as a five sensed animal with the power of rational thinking, it may take birth as a wild or cruel beast such as a lion or a tiger, which kills and eat many weaker animals like deer and rabbits etc.
