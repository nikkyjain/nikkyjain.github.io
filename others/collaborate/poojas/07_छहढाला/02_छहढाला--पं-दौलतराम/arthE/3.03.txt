To have faith in the nature of seven Tattvas (Realities) i.e. Jeev (Soul), Ajeev (Non-soul), Aashrav (Influx of karamas), Bandh (Bondage of karmas), Sanvar (Stoppage of the influx of karmas), Nirajaraa (Shedding of karmas) and Moksh (Freedom from karmas) as pronounced by Bhagawaan Jinendra is the Right Faith from the practical point of view. I (the author) am going to describe them. Listen them carefully in their general (Saamaany) and particular (Vishesh) aspects so as to keep firm faith in your hearts.
