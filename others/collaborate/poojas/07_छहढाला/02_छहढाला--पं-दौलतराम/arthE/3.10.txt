Moksh or salvation is the state completely free from the karmas. It is permanent and blissful. (This is the description of Moksh Tattv.) To have faith on the seven Tattvas as described above is Right Faith from practical point of view. Also belief in Jinendra Bhagawaan, Nirgranth or passionless preceptor and compassionate religion is the cause of the Right Faith. This Right Faith is to be attained along with all its eight limbs (qualities).
