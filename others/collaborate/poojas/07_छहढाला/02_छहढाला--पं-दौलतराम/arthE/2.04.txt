Instead of knowing the true nature of soul being forever consciousness, the ignorant soul thinks that he is the body, and performs the functions of the body. If the body is healthy then it is beneficial to him. He is happy with the favorable external surroundings and unhappy with unfavorable situations. He is poor or rich. He is strong or weak. He is human and is handsome or ugly. He is wise or a fool. He believes to have wife, sons, wealth, house and animal wealth.
