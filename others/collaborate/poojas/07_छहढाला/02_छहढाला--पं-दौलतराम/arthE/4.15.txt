Each of the twelve vows of a religious house-holder has five infirmities, which should be avoided. At the time of death, one should follow the ideal religious death (Sannyaas) and avoid the infirmities of this vow also. The house-holder, who observes these twleve vows as laid down here without infirmities, would be able to take birth in any of the sixteen heavenly abodes. After completing the life in the heaven, taking human birth and becoming monk, one attains salvation.
