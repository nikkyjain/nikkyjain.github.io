(In the state of pure Self-meditation), the monks engross in themselves by meditating in this manner (thus). The unexpressible bliss they attain is described as not enjoyed even by the Lord of heaven, the Lord of Bhavanavaasee Devas, the Lord of human beings and the Self-Lord of the highest heaven. With the fire of the pure Self-meditation, the monks burn the jungle of four destructive karmas. They thus perceive all with omniscience and reveal the way of spiritual well-being to the people, who are capable of liberation.
