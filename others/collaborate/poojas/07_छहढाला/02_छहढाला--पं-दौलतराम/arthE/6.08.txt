They (monks) have broken (their) ignorance with the help of a highly sharp chisel of spiritually evolved intellect (Bhed Vijnaan) and they feel separated themselves from all attributes of Pudgal like colour etc. and passionate feelings like attachment etc. They have realized themselves, for themselves and by themselves. In such a state there remains no distinction between pure nature of self & its attributes and among knowledge (Jnaan), the knower (Jnaataa) & the object to be known (Jneya).
