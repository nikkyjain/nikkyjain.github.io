One of the liberated Great Souls-the Siddhaas are without body. They have perfect knowledge and are completely free from all the three types of karmic filth. They shall remain forever in eternal spiritual bliss. Renounce the state of Bahiraatmaa realizing that it is worth renouncing, attain the state of Antaraatmaa and meditate always over Paramaatmaa for attaining eternal spiritual bliss.
