It is the stage where there remains no distinction of meditation, meditator and the object of meditation; nor is there any other distinction of expression through language. There the conscious manifestations (chidbhaav) are the objects (karma), the conscious souls (Chidesh) are the doers (subjects) and the consciousness (itself) is the action. All these three are non-distinct, undisturbed and steady state of pure self meditation. When such a state arises, (Right) Faith, (Right) Knowledge and (Right) Conduct-all the three thought lines shine as one.
