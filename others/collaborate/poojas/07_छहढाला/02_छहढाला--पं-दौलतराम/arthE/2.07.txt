When there is partial increase of purity then there is proportionate shedding of the impurity in the soul. This is known as the shedding associated with the stoppage of karma. This occurs only with the right faith from absolute point of view. When one is engrossed within oneself, then there is dissociation of auspicious and inauspicious desires. This is known as 'shedding' element or austerity.
Austerity is classified in two ways: 1. Austerity associated with the wrong faith and 2. Austerity associated with the right faith.
Austerity performed in the wrong faith cannot give any true or meaningful shedding of karma. Austerity performed with the right faith, when there is an absence of auspicious and inauspicious desires, is the real reason for shedding of karma.
The wrong believer does not understand this fact. He forgets his infinite strength from self-absorption and instead believes to have happiness derived from alien substances. He is unable to control his auspicious and inauspicious desires and the liking of the objects of five senses. This is the misconception regarding the 'shedding' element.
Pure and perfect tranquility with the bliss from within is the nature of the liberation element. In this state there is complete purity of the soul. This is the real nature of true happiness. However, the ignorant soul does not accept this fact. He thinks happiness comes with the help of body, five senses and objects of five senses. This is the misconception regarding 'liberation' element.
Inborn wrong knowledge (agruhit mithyaa gyaan): The presence of knowledge along with the inborn wrong faith is known as inborn wrong knowledge (anaadi mithyaa gyaan) and can produce intense misery. This knowledge is not acquired by listening to the sermons but is present with the soul since time infinite.
