One who worships the false preachers, false Lords and false religion (kudharma)is always feeding the right belief deluding karma (darshan mohaniya karma). This is known as the acquired wrong faith.
The false preacher has delusion from within and indulges in external wealth and clothes. He poses as an ascetic with the mark of clothing (dravya lingi muni). He has no attributes of a real ascetic as described in the scriptures. They are like a stone boat sinking in the ocean of transmigration.
The false gods are inherent with the filth of attachment and aversion and are identified with the signs of woman and club etc.
By worshiping false preachers and false gods, one increases his acquired wrong faith and as a result continues to wander in the transmigratory cycle.
