The feeling of attachment always burns like a fire and therefore you should enjoy the nectar of equanimity. You have been indulging in passions and sensual pleasures from very beginning. Now give up them. You should realize your own true nature (position). Why are you interested in others? It is not your nature. For what are you facing inflictions? O Doulatram! be happy by being engrossed in your own nature and do not miss this chance or opportunity.
