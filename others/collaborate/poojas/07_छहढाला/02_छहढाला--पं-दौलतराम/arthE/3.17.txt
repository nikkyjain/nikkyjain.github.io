Right Faith is the first step of (leading to) the palace of Moksh. In its absence, Knowledge and Conduct do not earn the quality of righteousness. This Right Faith is, therefore attained by liberable and holy ones (Bhavy Jeev). O Doulatram! Understand, listen and be awake. Do not waste your time vainly; (Author is exhorting everyone as well as himself) because it is difficult to get this human life again if you do not earn the Right Faith.
