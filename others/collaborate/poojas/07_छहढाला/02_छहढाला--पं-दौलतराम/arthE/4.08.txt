Jinendra Bhagawaan has stated that whosoever (those) persons have attained salvation in the past, whosoever are attaining at present and whosoever shall attain in the future, is all due to the glory of Right Knowledge. In this mundane world, the desires of mundane pleasures like forest-fire are burning the people (Jeevas). There is no other way of safety; only the Right Knowledge like dense clouds can extinguish the fire of mundane pleasures.
