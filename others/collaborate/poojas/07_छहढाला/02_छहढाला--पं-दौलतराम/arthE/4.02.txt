Right Faith and Right Knowledge manifest simultaneously but they should be understood distinctively. The characteristic of Right Faith is the belief while that of Right Knowledge is knowing. This distinction (between them) is uncontradicted. Right Faith is the cause and Right Knowledge is its effect, although both of them occur simultaneously, like lighting the lamp and emission of light from it.
