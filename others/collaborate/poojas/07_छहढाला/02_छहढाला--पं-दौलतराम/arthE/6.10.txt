In the stage of pure self-meditation flash of comprehensive knowledge, partial cognitions with standpoints and the installations of objects are not experienced. (The soul) is bestowed only with (infinite) perception, (infinite) knowledge, (infinite) bliss and (infinite) power. Nothing else exists in the soul. The only manifestation is "I am to be achieved; I am the achiever. I stand unhampered by the karmas and their fruition. I am a mass of consciousness, I am glorious, I am undivided, I am a basket of excellent qualities and I am devoid of all sins & body."
