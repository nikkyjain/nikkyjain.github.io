Therefore one must study (or practice) the principles (Tattvas) as pronounced by Bhagawaan Jinendra, and realize the nature of pure soul by keeping off Sanshay (doubt), Vibhram (perversion) and Moh (indifference). It is very rare to get this human birth, noble family (higher clan) and the opportunity to listen to the preachings of Jinendra. After all this, if one does not take full advantage of this opportunity, it is like not regaining a ruby that (after being thrown) has gone deep in the ocean.
