The (spiritual) wellbeing of the soul is in attainment of spiritual bliss. Spiritual bliss means state of the soul free from disquiet. There is no disquiet in the state of salvation. Therefore one must follow the path of salvation. The path of salvation consists of the Right Faith, Right knowledge and Right Conduct all together and it is considered in two aspects. That which is actual or internal path is the path of salvation from the real point of view and that, which is the cause of actual path, is the path of salvation from the practical point of view.
