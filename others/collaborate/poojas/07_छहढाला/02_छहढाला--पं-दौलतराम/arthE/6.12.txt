After destroying the remaining (four) non-destructive karmas, they enter the state of Siddhas within a moment to live in the eighth earth (abode of Siddhas). This is the state of Siddh hood. On account of the destruction of the eight karmas, eight excellent qualities like Right Faith etc. shine in them. They reach the final shore after crossing the ocean of Sansaar (world) which is salty (full of sufferings) and huge (limitless) in dimension. Then they become free from distortions, embodiment and the material qualities; and consequently become pure, fully conscious and immortal.
