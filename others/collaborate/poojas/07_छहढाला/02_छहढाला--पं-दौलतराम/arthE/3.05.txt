Those souls who have Right Faith but do not follow any vows are the Jaghany Antaraatmaa. All these three are the followers of the path of salvation. Those who have attained the highest spiritual development are of two kinds i.e. with body and without body. They are called Parmaatmaa (omniscient). Amongs them, those who have destroyed all (four) Ghaatiyaa karmas are revered Arihantas known as Sakal Parmaatmaa.
