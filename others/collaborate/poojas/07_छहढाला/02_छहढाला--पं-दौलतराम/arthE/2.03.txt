Matter, medium of motion, medium of rest, space and time are the five non-sentient substances of the universe. The soul is forever an embodiment of knowledge (gyaan swaroop) and is separate from these non-living non-sentient substances. The soul with the wrong belief has no true understanding of this fact. In ignorance he believes himself to be the body, and further believes that he can perform the activities of the body and that the body is functioning with his desire. This wrong belief makes him under -stand that the body and the soul are one and the same. This is the wrong belief about the understanding of the living element (jiva tattva).
