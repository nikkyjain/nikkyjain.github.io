If one's father or maternal uncle happens to be the king, one should not entertain pride (on this account). One should neither have proud of handsome appearance, proud of knowledge, proud of wealth nor proud of power. One should not feel proud of one's austerities (penance) and (one's) authority. If one does not feel proud in its various forms, one can know one's self. If one keeps these prides, it pollutes one's Right Faith with these eight infirmities.
