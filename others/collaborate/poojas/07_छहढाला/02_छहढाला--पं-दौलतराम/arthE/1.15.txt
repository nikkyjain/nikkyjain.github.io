As a result of involuntary dissociation of karma (akaam nirjaraa), the living being is now born as a celestial being. Here he could be born as a mansion dwelling (bhavanpati), a wandering (vyantar) or as a stellar (jyotistha) celestial living being. In these lives the living being is burning with sensual desire like a wild fire. At the time of death, he weeps bitterly and suffers intense agony.
