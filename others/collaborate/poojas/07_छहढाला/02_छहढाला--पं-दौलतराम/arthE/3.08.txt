Aakaash (space) accommodates all the substances. Kaal Dravy is of two kinds -- Nishchaya Kaal and Vyavahaar Kaal. That which helps in changeability or continuity of all the substances is known as Vartnaa from real point of view (Nishchay Kaal). Night, day etc. are modes of measuring time from practical point of view (Vyavahaar Kaal). This is the description of the non-soul (Ajeev Dravy). Now, listen the principle of influx (or Aashrav). The vibrations (of the spacepoints of the soul) of mind, speech and body, Mithyaatv, Avirati, Kasaay and Pramaad are the causes of the influx of karma in the soul.
