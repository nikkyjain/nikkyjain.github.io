The author has composed these Six Cantos based on the similar work done by Pandit Budhjan on Beashaakh Shukl Tratiyaa, Vikram Samvat 1891. The author exhibits his humility by stating that because of limited knowledge and carelessness (Pramaad), some errors might have crept in. Therefore the learned may correct them and attain power to swim this mundane ocean.
