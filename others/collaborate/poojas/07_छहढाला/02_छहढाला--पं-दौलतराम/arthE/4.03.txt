Right Knowledge is of two kinds-direct or immediate (Pratyaksh) and indirect or mediate (Paroksh). Among them the Sensual Knowledge and Scriptural Knowledge are indirect, because these are acquired with the help of sense organs and mind. Avadhi (clairvoyance) and Manaparjay (telepathy) are partially direct, as with these a Jeev knows (things) directly with limitations of substances and places.
