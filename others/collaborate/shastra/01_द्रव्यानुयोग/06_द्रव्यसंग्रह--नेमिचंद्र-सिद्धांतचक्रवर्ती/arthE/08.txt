From the empirical point of view (vyavahāra naya) , the soul is said to be the producer of karmic matter (like knowledgeobscuring karma); from the impure transcendental point of view (ashuddha nishcaya naya), the soul is responsible for its psychic dispositions (like attachment and aversion); but from the pure transcendental point of view (shuddha nishchaya naya), the soul is consciousness – pure perception and knowledge.
