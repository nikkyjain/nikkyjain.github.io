Conduct (charitra), from the empirical point of view, consists in desisting oneself from demerit (pāpa) – noncommendable activities – and engaging in merit (punya) – commendable activities. Lord Jina has proclaimed that this empirical conduct is observed through five vows (vratas), five regulations (samitis), and three controls (guptis).
