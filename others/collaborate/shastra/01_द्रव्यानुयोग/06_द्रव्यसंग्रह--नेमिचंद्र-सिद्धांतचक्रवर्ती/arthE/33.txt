Bondage is of four kinds according to its nature or species (prakrti bandha), duration (sthiti bandha), intensity of fruition (anubhāga bandha), and quantity of space-points (pradeśa bandha). Nature bondage and quantity of space-points bondage are due to activity (yoga), and duration bondage, and intensity of fruition bondage are due to passions (kashāya).
