There are innumerable space-points in a soul (jiva), the medium of motion (dharma), and the medium of rest (adharma). Space (ākāsha) has infinite space-points. Matter (pudgala) has numerable, innumerable and infinite space-points. Time (kāla) has just one space-point and, therefore, it is not called kāya.
