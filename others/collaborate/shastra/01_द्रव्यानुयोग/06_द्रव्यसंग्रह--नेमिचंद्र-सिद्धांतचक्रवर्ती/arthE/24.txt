The aforesaid five substances (dravyas) – soul (jiva), matter (pudgala), the medium of motion (dharma), the medium of rest (adharma), and space (ākāsha) – exist eternally, therefore, these are called 'asti' by Lord Jina; since each has many spacepoints, these are also called 'kāya'. Combining the two qualities (existence and space quality), these are termed as the five astikāyas (pancāstikāyas).
