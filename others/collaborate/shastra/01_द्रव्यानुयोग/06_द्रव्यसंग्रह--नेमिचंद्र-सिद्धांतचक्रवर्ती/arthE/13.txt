The transmigrating souls (samsari jivas), from the empirical point of view (vyavahāra naya), are of fourteen kinds based on the method of inquiry into their nature (mārganāsthāna), also of fourteen kinds based on their stage of spiritual development (gunasthāna). From the transcendental point of view (nishchaya naya), however, all souls are intrinsically pure.
