Belief in substances, souls and non-souls, as these actually are, is right faith. Right faith is an inherent attribute of the soul. Having achieved right faith, knowledge of these substances, without fallacies of doubt (samsaya), error or perversity (vimoha or viparyaya), and uncertainty or indefiniteness (vibhrama or anadhyavasāya), is right knowledge.
