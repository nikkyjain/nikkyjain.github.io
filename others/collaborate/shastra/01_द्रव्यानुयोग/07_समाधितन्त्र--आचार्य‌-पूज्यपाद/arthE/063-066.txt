Just as a man wearing thick clothes does not consider himself to have become thick, similarly, the wise ones do not consider themselves as being fat even when their body becomes fat. (For they realise that the soul and the body are distinct entities.)
Just as a man wearing old clothes does not consider himself to have become old, similarly, the wise ones do not consider themselves as being old even when their body becomes old. (For they realise that the soul and the body are distinct entities.)
Just as a man wearing torn clothes does not consider himself to have become torn, similarly, the wise ones do not consider themselves as being torn even when their body becomes torn/damaged. (For they realise that the soul and the body are distinct entities.)
Just as a man wearing red clothes does not consider himself to have become red, similarly, the wise ones do not consider themselves as being red even when their body becomes red. (For they realise that the soul and the body are distinct entities.)
