If the soul were made up of the elements of nature (earth, water, fire, wind and sky) death would mean a return of all the elements to their original form and there would be no effort required for liberation. If you believe that the soul is always pure and unbound and not sullied by karmic association, then too, no effort is required for liberation.
Since the soul will attain liberation after death, if liberation is attained through yogic practices, then too, there is no problem since yogIs on the path of liberation remain unperturbed in the face of hardships.
