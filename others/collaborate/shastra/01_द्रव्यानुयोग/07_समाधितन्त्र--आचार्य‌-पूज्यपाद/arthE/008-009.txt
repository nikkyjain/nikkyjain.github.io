BahirAtmA believes that the soul changes according to the body it occupies. Thus, he considers the soul residing in a human body to be human, The soul living in a sub-human body to be subhuman, And the soul endowed with a celestial being's body to be a celestial being.
BahirAtmA believes that the soul residing in the body of a hellish being is a hellish being. But this is not in accordance with reality. In truth, the soul possesses infinite knowledge and power, can only be experienced (not seen or known through the senses) and is constant (eternal).
