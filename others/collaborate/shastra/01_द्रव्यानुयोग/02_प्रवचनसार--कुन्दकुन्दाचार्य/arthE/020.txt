On destruction of the four inimical (ghati) karmas, the self-dependent soul 'svayambhu' attains infinite knowledge (that illumines the self as well as all other objects) and indestructible happiness, both beyond the five senses (as such, termed atindriya). On destruction of the obstructive (antaraya) karma, it is endowed with infinite strength. Thus, as the four inimical (ghati) karmas are destroyed, the soul attains supreme lustre (teja) that is its own-nature (svabhava).
