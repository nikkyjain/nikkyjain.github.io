Lord Jina has said that the transformation of the soul (jīva) into dispositions (bhāva) of knowledge that makes distinction (vikalpa) between objects (artha), the self (jīva) and the non-self (ajīva), is knowledge-consciousness (gyānachetanā). The activity (karma) of the soul (jīva) in form of dispositions (bhāva) of various kinds is the karma-consciousness (karma-chetanā or bhāva-karma). And, the fruit of karmas in form of either happiness (sukha) or misery (dukha) is the fruit-of-karma-consciousness (karma-phala-chetanā).
