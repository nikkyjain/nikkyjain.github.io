The Doctrine expounds that the ascetic (muni, shramana) whose activities are without due diligence certainly engenders bondage of karmas as he causes injury (hinsā) to six classes of embodied beings. The ascetic who incessantly observes diligence in his activities does not engender bondage of karmas; he remains unblemished as the lotus-flower remains untouched by the water though it grows in the water.
