From the standpoint-of-substance (dravyārthika naya), as the substance (dravya) remains the same, the object (vastu) is 'notother' (ananya) in different modes (paryāya). From the standpoint-of-modes (paryāyārthika naya), as the object takes the form of the mode (paryāya), it is said to be 'other' (anya) with each change of the mode (paryāya).
