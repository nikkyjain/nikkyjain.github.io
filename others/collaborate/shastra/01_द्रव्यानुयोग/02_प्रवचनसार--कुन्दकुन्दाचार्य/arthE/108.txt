The substance (dravya) - with its qualities (guna) and modes (paryāya) - rests in own nature (svabhāvasiddha). Lord Jina, the expounder of the Reality, has said that existence (sat) is the nature of the substance (dravya). He, who does not have faith in this Reality, is engaged in impure-soul nature (parasamaya); he is a wrong-believer (mithyadristi).
