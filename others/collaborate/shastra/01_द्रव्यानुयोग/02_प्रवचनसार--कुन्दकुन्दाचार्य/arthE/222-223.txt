The Omniscient Lord has expounded that five supreme vows (mahāvrata), five regulations (samiti), fivefold control of the senses (panchendriya nirodha), pulling out the hair on the head and the face (kesh-loncha), six essential duties (āvashyaka), renouncing clothes (nāgnya, digambaratva), not taking bath (asnāna), sleeping on the ground (bhūmishayana), not cleansing the teeth (adantadhāvan), taking food in steady, standing posture (sthitibhojan), and taking food only once in a day (ekabhukti), are certainly the twenty-eight primary attributes (mūlagun) that make the ascetic (shramana) steady in his conduct. Negligence in the practise of these primary attributes calls for their reestablishment as per the rules.
