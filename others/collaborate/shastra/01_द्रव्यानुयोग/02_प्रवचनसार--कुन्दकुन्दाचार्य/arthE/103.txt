Certainly, all objects-of-knowledge (gyaeya) are substances (dravya) having existence as their general nature. All substances (dravya) have qualities (guna) and due to transformation in substance and qualities, modes (paryāya) exist; thus, modes (paryāya) are of two kinds: mode-of-substance (dravyaparyāya) and mode-of-qualities (gunaparyāya). Those who mistake the mode (paryāya) for the substance (dravya) are wrong-believers (mithyadrsti).
