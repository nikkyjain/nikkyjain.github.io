The substances (dravya), their qualities (guna - which exhibit association - anvaya), and modes (paryāya - which exhibit distinction or exclusion - vyatireka), are known as objects (artha). The Omniscient Lord has expounded that the substance (dravya) is the substratum of qualities (guna) and modes (paryāya).
