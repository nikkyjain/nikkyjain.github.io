Thus, the soul (atma, jiva) is the knowledge (gyaana). The substance (dravya) is the object-of-knowledge (gyaeya). The object-of-knowledge (gyaeya) is expressed in any of these threeways - past, present and future modes (paryaya); origination (utpada), destruction (vyaya) and permanence (dhrauvya); substance (dravya), quality (gun) and mode (paryaya). Further, since the substances - the soul (jiva) and the non-soul (ajiva) - undergo modification, the above modes of expression are used.
