The transformation (parinama) - in form of origination (utpāda), destruction (vyaya) and permanence (dhruavya) - in own-nature (svabhāva) of the substance (dravya) is, certainly, the quality (guna) of existence (sattā). Because the substance (dravya) is established in this quality (guna) of existence (sattā), it is called 'satâ' - that which exists. This is the Doctrine of Lord Jina.
