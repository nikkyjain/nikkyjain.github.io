Attainment of the status of the Omniscient Lord - the Arhat (Tirthankara, Kevali, Sarvagyaa) - is the fruit of the past meritorious karmas. In addition, the activities of the Arhat are certainly due to the fruition of auspicious karmas. The activities of the Arhat do not take place due to the dispositions of delusion (moha), attachment (raga) and aversion (dvesha). His activities take place on complete destruction (kshaya) of the inimical (ghati) karmas, including the deluding (mohaniya) karma.
