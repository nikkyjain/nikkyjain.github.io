The worthy head (āchārya) - guru - who grants initiation (dīkshā), with the external as well as the internal marks (linga), into the congregation is called the pravrajyādāyaka or the dīkshādāyaka or the dīkshāguru. Subsequently, as and when the ascetic fails to observe restraints as specified, the other worthy heads (āchārya) - guru - may reinitiate him in the right course of conduct; these worthy heads (āchārya) are called the niryāpakaguru.
