The ascetics (muni, shramana) who are rid of the dispositions due to inauspicious-cognition (ashubhopayoga) and are engaged in pure-cognition (shuddhopayoga) or auspicious-cognition (shubhopayoga) help the worthy souls cross the ocean of worldly existence. The one who is devoted to these two kinds of ascetics attains excellent status.
