The molecules (skandha) of matter (pudgala) fit to turn into karmas - kārmānaa-varganā - when in association with the impure dispositions of the soul (jīva) transform themselves into (eight types of) karmas. The soul (jīva) is not the cause of this transformation of the molecules (skandha) of matter (pudgala) into karmas; the molecules of matter have inherent power to turn into karmas.
