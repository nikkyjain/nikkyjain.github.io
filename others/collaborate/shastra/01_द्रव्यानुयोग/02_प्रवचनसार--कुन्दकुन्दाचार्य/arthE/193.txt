The transformation of the soul (jīva) in auspicious (shubha) dispositions, which are other than its innate nature, is merit (punya). The transformation of the soul (jīva) in inauspicious (ashubha) dispositions is demerit (pāpa). The Doctrine expounds that the transformation that does not delve into either dispositions is the cause of the destruction of misery (dukha).
