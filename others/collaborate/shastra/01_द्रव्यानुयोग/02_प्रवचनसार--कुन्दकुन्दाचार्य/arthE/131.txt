Mired in karmic dirt and because of the influence of the karmas bound with it, the soul (j카va) undergoes impure transformations, like delusion (moha) and attachment (r훮ga). Due to such impure transformations, the particles of karmic matter fasten to the space-points (pradesha) of the soul (j카va). Hence, impure transformations (like attachment) of the soul - its bh훮vakarma - are the cause of bondage of material-karmas (dravyakarma).
