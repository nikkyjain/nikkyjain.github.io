Lord Jina has expounded that the part of the substance of space (ākāsha dravya) that an indivisible atom (paramānau) occupies is known as the space-point (pradesha) of space (ākāsha). One spacepoint (pradesha) of space (ākāsha) has the power to accommodate the atoms (paramānau) of all the remaining substances including the infinite indivisible atoms and molecules of matter (pudgala-paramānau and pudgala-skandha).
