The soul-substance (jīva dravya) is marked by cognition (upayoga) that manifests in knowledge-cognition (gyānopayoga) and perception-cognition (darshanopayoga). Certainly, the two kinds of cognition (upayoga) of the soul (jīva) are in form of either auspicious-cognition (shubhopayoga) or inauspicious cognition (ashubhopayoga).
