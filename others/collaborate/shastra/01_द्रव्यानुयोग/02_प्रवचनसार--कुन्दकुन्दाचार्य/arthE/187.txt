When the soul (jīva) having cognition (upayoga) - in form of knowledge (gyāna) and perception (darshana) - engenders dispositions of delusion (moha), attachment (rāga) and aversion (dvesha) for the objects of the senses, it again gets bound with those dispositions (of delusion, attachment and aversion).
