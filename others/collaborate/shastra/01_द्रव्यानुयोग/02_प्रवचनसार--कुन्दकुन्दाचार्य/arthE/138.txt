The space (ākash) is infinite (ananta) and gives room to the souls (jīva) and the matter (pudgala). The medium of motion (dharmāstikāya), the medium of rest (adharmāstikāya), and the time (kāla) permeate this universe-space (lokākāsha). This much of the space is the universe-space (lokākāsha), in the three times - the past, the present and the future.
