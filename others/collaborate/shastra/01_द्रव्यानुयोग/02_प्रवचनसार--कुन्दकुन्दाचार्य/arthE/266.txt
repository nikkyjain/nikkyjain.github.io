He, who has attained concentration (ekāgratā) (of knowldege, perception and conduct), is called the ascetic (muni, shramana). Concentration is attained by him who has right knowledge of the objects. Right knowledge is obtained from the Scripture, the Doctrine of Lord Jina. Therefore, it is important for the ascetic to study the Scripture.
