Having worshipped the Tirthankara (the Arhat), the Liberated Souls (the Siddha), the Chief Preceptors (āchārya), the Preceptors (upadhyaya) and the Ascetics (sādhu), I adopt the state of equanimity (sāmya), i.e., passionless conduct-without attachment (vitarāg chāritra).
I adopt this state of equanimity (sāmya), the source of attainment of liberation, from the five Supreme Beings who are the principal abode of pristine faith and knowledge.
