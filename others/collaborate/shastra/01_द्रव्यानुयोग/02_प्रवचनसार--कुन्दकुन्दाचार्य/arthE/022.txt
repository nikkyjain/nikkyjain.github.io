For sure, all substances (dravya) and their modes (paryāya) reflect directly (and simultaneously) in the perfect-knowledge (kevalagyāna) of the Omniscient. The Omniscient knows all substances and their modes directly and simultaneously as he does not rely on the sensory-knowledge that knows substances in stages - apprehension (avagraha) etc.
