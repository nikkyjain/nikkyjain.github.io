The ascetic (muni, shramana) whose only possession (parigraha) is his body (shar카ra), does not carry the sense-of-ownership with itand, therefore, does not perform activities of partaking of food(훮h훮ra) and roaming (vih훮ra) inappropriately. He employs hisbody for austerity (tapa), without concealing his strength.
