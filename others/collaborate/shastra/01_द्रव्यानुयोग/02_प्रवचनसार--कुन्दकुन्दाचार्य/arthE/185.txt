The atoms (paramānu) or molecules (skandha), with qualities of taste (rasa), colour (varna), smell (gandha), and touch (sparsha), of the matter (pudgala), which is with form (mūrta), are able to combine due to their attributes of greasiness or roughness. How can the soul (jīva), which does not have these qualities, form bonds of karmas with the matter (pudgala)?
