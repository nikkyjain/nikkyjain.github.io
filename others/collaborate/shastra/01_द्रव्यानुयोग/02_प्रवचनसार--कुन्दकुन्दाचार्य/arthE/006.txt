The soul attains liberation (nirvana, moksha) by virtue of conduct (charitra), characterized by right faith (samyagdarsan) and right knowledge (samyagyaan). The path to liberation is accompanied by the glory of the lords of the heavenly devas (kalpavasi devas), other devas (bhavanavasi, vyantar and jyotishk devas), and humans.
