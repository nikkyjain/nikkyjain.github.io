I - the pure soul (jÄ«va) - am not of the nature of the body; I am not of the nature of the mind; and certainly, I am not of the nature of the speech. I am not the cause of their activities (of the body, the mind and the speech); I am not the doer, the administrator, or the approver of these activities.
