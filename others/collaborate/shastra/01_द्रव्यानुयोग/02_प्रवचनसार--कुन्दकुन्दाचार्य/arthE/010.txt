Substance (dravya) does not exist without the mode (paryaya). As a rule, at no time substance (dravya) can exist without its modification (parinama). Only in imagination can the substance exist without its modification, like a kharavishaana  the 'horns of a hare'. Different modes of cow-produce (gorasa)  like milk, curd, butter, cheese and buttermilk  exist due to the presence of cow-produce; in the same way, modes (paryaya) exist only due to the presence of the substance (dravya). In addition, without the existence of the substance (dravya), modifications (parinama) cannot exist. It is because the substance (dravya) is the source or foundation of modifications (parinama); if there were no substance (dravya), on what would its modifications (parinama) subsist? If there were no cow-produce (gorasa), on what would milk, curd, butter, cheese and buttermilk subsist? The existence of an object can only be established with the existence of all three  the substance (dravya), the quality (gun), and the mode (paryaya).
