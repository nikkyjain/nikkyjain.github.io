As per the Doctrine, the ascetics (muni, shramana) are of two kinds, those engaged in pure-cognition (shuddhopayoga) and those engaged in auspicious-cognition (shubhopayoga). The ascetics engaged in pure-cognition (shuddhopayoga) are rid of the influx (ƒÅsrava) of karmas and the rest, engaged in auspiciouscognition (shubhopayoga), are with the influx of karmas.
