The transformation of the soul (j카va) into impure-cognition (ashuddhopayoga) is the cause of bondage (dravyabandha). This transformation of the soul (j카va) is due to dispositions of attachment (r훮ga), aversion (dvesha), and delusion (moha). Dispositions of delusion (moha) and aversion (dvesha) are inauspicious (ashubha). Disposition of attachment (r훮ga) is auspicious (shubha) as well as inauspicious (ashubha).
