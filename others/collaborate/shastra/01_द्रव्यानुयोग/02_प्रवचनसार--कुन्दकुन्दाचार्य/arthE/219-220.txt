The external-marks (dravyalinga) of the ascetic are that he adopts the nude form that is natural-by-birth (n훮gnya, yath훮j훮ta), pulls out his hair of the head and the face by hand, being pure, he is free from activities that cause injury, and does not attend to the body. The internal-marks (bh훮valinga) - the cause of cessation of births - of the ascetic are that he is free from infatuation for possessions, has purity of the cognition (upayoga) and the activities (yoga), and is free from dependence on everything external.
