The Pure-Soul (shuddhātmā) possesses true asceticism (shrāmanya); it is endowed with infinite perception (darshana) and knowledge (gyāna), and attains the supreme state of liberation (nirvāna, moksha). True asceticism (shrāmanya), with ineffable and permanent bliss, is really the liberated-soul (the Siddha). With extreme devotion, I bow to the Siddha.
