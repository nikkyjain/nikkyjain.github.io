When the soul entertains auspicious (shubha) or inauspicious (ashubha) dispositions, it becomes auspicious (shubha) or inauspicious (ashubha). When the soul entertains pure (shuddha) disposition  conduct-without-attachment (vitaraga charitra)  it turns into the pure (shuddha) soul. Thus, the soul, by nature (svabhāva), undergoes three kinds of modifications (parināma).
