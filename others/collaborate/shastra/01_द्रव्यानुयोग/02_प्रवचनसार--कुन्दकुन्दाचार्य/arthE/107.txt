The Supreme Omniscient Lord, the expounder of the nature of substances - dharma - has said that in this world though substances exist with their own distinctive marks (lakshana), still all substances are characterized by one common mark (lakshana), and that is 'existence-in-general' - sāmānyāstitva or sāddrishyāstitva. This mark is universal (sarvagata) to all substances.
