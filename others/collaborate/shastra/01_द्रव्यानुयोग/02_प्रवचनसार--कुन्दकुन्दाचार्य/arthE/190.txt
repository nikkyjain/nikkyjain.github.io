The soul (jīva, ātmā) has innumerable space-points (pradesha). The karmic molecules penetrate the space-points of the soul and make bonds when there is vibration in the space-points of the soul due to the activity of the mind, the speech and the body. These karmic molecules remain bound with the soul for certain duration and then separate on fruition.
