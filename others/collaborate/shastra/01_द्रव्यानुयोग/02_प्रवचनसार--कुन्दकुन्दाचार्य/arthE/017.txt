The soul that has attained its own-nature (svabhava) through pure-cognition (shuddhopayoga) experiences origination (utpada) of its own-nature (svabhava) that is without destruction (vyaya or nasa), and destruction (vyaya or nasa) of the earlier impure state that is without origination (utpada). In addition, there is inseparable amalgamation of permanence (dhrauvya) of its own-nature (svabhava), origination (utpada) of the state of pure-cognition (suddhopayoga), and destruction (vyaya) of the earlier impure state.
