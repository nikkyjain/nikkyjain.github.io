This world continually witnesses the phenomenon of destruction (vināsha, vyaya). Still, there is neither origination (utpāda) nor destruction (vināsha) of the substance (dravya). The substance (dravya) subsists through the origination (utpāda) as well as the destruction (vināsha). Moreover, the two phenomena - origination (utpāda) and destruction (vināsha) - are different [as there is the change of modes (paryāya)].
