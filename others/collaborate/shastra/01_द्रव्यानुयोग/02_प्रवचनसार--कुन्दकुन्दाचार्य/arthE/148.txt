The atom (paramānau) occupies one space-point (pradesha). With this unit of measurement, there are infinite space-points (pradesha) in the substance of space (ākāsha dravya). Similarly, the space-points of the remaining substances - the medium of motion (dharma dravya), the medium of rest (adharma dravya) and individual soul (jīva dravya) - are measured with this unit of measurement. The indivisible atom of matter (pudgalaparamānau) does not have two or more space-points (pradesha); it occupies just one space-point (pradesha). The atom (paramānau) is the source of space-points (pradesha).
