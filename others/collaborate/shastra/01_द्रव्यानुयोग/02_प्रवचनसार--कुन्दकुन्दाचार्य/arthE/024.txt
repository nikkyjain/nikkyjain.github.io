The soul (ātmā) is coextensive with knowledge (gyāna). Lord Jina has expounded that knowledge (gyāna) is coextensive with the objects-of-knowledge (gyaeya). All objects of the universe (loka) and beyond (aloka) are the objects-of-knowledge (gyaeya). Therefore, knowledge is all-pervasive (sarvagata or sarvavyāpaka); it knows everything.
