The time taken by the indivisible atom of matter (pudgalaparamānau) in traversing slowly one space-point (pradesha) of the space (ākāsha) is the mode (paryāya) of time (kāla), called the 'samaya' (the smallest, indivisible unit of time). The eternal substance (dravya) that continues to exist before and after the mode (paryāya), called the 'samaya', is the substance of time (kāla dravya). The mode (paryāya), i.e., the 'samaya', undergoes origination and destruction.
