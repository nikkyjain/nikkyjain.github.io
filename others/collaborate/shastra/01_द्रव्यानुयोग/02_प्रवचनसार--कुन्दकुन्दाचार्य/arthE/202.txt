Lord Jina (the Arhat) has discoursed for the ascetics that the transformation of the worldly soul (jīva) into the state of attachment (rāga) etc. in the aforesaid manner is, in essence, the real (nishchaya) bondage (bandha). The other kind of bondage (of the karmic matter with the soul) is the empirical (vyavahāra) bondage (bandha).
