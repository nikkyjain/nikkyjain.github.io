Lord Jina has expounded that as the soul (jīva) knows and sees the objects of the senses with dispositions of delusion (moha), attachment (rāga) and aversion (dvesha), it attains the form of those dispositions and gets into psychic-bondage (bhāvabandha); as a consequence, it is bound with (eight kinds of) material-karmas (dravyakarma).
