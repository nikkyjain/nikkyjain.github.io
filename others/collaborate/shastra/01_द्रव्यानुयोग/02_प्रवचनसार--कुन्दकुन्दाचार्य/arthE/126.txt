Modes or states of existence, such as the human or the infernal being, are not permanent. It cannot be maintained that these modes are not due to the activity of the soul that is not in its natural-state (svabh훮va). These definitely are due to the activity of the soul in its unnatural state (caused by its association with the matter). The activity with excellent conduct-without attachment (v카tar훮ga) does not yield fruit of states of existence like the human or the infernal being, but, certainly, the activity with attachment (r훮ga) is not without fruit.
