The ascetic (muni, shramana) whose soul (ātmā), by nature, does not partake of external substances like food, remains 'nirāhārī' - without food. To attain this 'nirāhārī' nature of the soul is certainly the internal austerity (tapa). The worthy-ascetic (mahāmuni) partakes of food and performs the activity of roaming with a view to seek this 'nirāhārī' nature of his soul. Therefore, such an ascetic does not partake of food; he is 'nirāhārī'.
