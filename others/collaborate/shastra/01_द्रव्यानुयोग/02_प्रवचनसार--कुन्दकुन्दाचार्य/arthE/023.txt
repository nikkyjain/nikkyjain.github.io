The knowledge of the Omniscient Lord is direct and simultaneous, always beyond the senses. The space-points of his pristine soul are not only inclusive of the power of the senses but, more than that, reflect simultaneously all objects. Certainly, the Omniscient Lord, by own making, is the embodiment of perfectknowledge (kevalagyāna).
