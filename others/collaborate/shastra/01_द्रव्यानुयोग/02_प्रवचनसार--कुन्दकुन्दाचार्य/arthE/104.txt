Lord Jina has expounded that those who rely solely on the modes (paryāya), like the human being, are the wrong-believers (mithyādrshti); such souls are engaged in impure-soul nature (parasamaya). Those who rely on own soul-nature, like knowledge (gyāna) and perception (darshana), are the right-believers  (samyagdrsti); such souls are engaged in pure-soul nature (svasamaya) and are worth knowing.
