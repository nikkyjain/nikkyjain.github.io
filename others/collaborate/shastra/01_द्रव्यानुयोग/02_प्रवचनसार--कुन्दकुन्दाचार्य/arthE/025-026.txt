The uninformed who does not admit that the soul (ātmā) is coextensive with knowledge (gyāna), must concede that the soul is either smaller or larger than knowledge. If the soul is smaller than knowledge, knowledge becomes insentient and loses its ability to know. If the soul is larger than knowledge, how will it know without knowledge?
