The course of conduct for the ascetic (muni, shramana) engaged in auspicious-cognition (subhopayoga) consists in devotion (bhakti) to the Arhat etc. (the five Supreme Beings), and fervent affection (vƒÅtsalya) - similar to the tender love of the cow for her calf - for the preceptors of the Doctrine.
