The substance (dravya) is of the nature of the existence (sattā), the quality (gunaa) is of the nature of the existence (sattā), and the mode (paryāya) is of the nature of the existence (sattā). Such is the extent of the existence (sattā). And, that which is the cause of difference between the existence (sattā), the substance (dravya), the quality (gunaa) and the mode (paryāya), is, certainly, the self-identity (anyatva) of all of these.
