The indivisible atom (paramānu) of the substance of matter (pudgala) does not occupy multiple space-points (pradesha); it occupies just one space-point (pradesha). By itself, it does not have the quality of sound (shabda). The atoms, with qualities of greasiness (snigdha) and roughness (rūksha), combine together to form molecules having two or more space-points (pradesha).
