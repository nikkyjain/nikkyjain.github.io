The contrary and ignorant view of the soul about substances - with respect to their substance (dravya), qualities (guna), and modes (paryāya) - is 'delusion' (moha). Enveloped by delusionof- perception (darshanmoha), the soul entertains dispositions of attachment (rāga) and aversion (dvesha), and suffers from anxiety (kshobha).
