Lord Jina has expounded that the ascetic (muni, sramana) who has right knowledge of the soul and other substances, is well versed in the Scripture, observes self-restraint (sanyama) and austerity (tapa), is free from attachment (raga), and for whom happiness (sukha) and misery (dukha) are alike, represents pure-cognition (shuddhopayoga).
