If the breach of proper restraint has occurred due to the activities of the body, though performed carefully, the ascetic must, after confession of the fault, follow the course of expiation as prescribed in the Scripture. If the breach has occurred due to perversion of the cognition (upayoga), the ascetic must approach a worthy head (āchārya), make confession, and take on the chastisement as prescribed by the guru.
