I make obeisance to Shrī Vardhamāna Svāmi, the Ford-maker (Tīrthańkara) and the expounder of the own-nature (svabhāva) or 'dharma', who is worshipped by the lords of the heavenly devas (kalpavāsī devas), other devas (bhavanavāsī, vyantara and jyotishka devas) and humans, and has washed off the dirt of inimical (ghātī) karmas.
