The soul (jīva) that knows well the nature of the substance (dravya) as existence-of-own-nature (svarūpāstitva) that has already been expounded as having three distinctions - substance (dravya), quality (gun), and mode (paryāya) or origination (utpāda), destruction (vyaya), and permanence (dhrauvya) - does not entertain delusion (moha) in respect of substances (dravya) that are different from the self.
