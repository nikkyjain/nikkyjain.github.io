The soul (jīva) whose cognition (upayoga) is strongly inclined towards sense-gratification and passions (kashāya) like anger, who listens to fallacious doctrines, contemplates on inauspicious dispositions, engages in destructive discussions, has cruel tendency, and holds false beliefs, engenders inauspiciouscognition (ashubhopayoga).
