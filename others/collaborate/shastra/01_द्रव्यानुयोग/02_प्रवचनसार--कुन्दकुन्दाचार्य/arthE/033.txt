From the transcendental-point-of-view (niscayanaya), the Omniscient Lord - the soul with kevalagyaana - neither accepts nor rejects the objects-of-knowledge (gyaeya), and the objects-of-knowledge (gyaeya) do not transform the soul. It sees and knows all objects-of-knowledge (gyeya), without exception.
