If the substance (dravya) is not of the nature of existence - i.e., if it is not sat - then its permanence (dhruvatva) must become nonexistent - asat. How can something that is non-existent - asat - be a substance (dravya), or how can a substance (dravya) exist - remain as sat - without the nature of existence? Therefore, the substance (dravya) is of the nature of existence - it is sat.
