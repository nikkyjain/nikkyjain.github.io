Since the soul (jīva), having innumerable space-points (pradesha), is tinged with passions (kashāya) in form of delusion (moha), attachment (rāga), and aversion (dvesha) in its worldly state, it is bound with the dust of the karmic matter (like the knowledge-obscuring gyānāvaranaīya karma). This is called the bondage (bandha) in the Scripture.
