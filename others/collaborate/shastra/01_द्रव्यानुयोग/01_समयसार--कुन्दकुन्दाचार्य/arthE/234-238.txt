The whiteness of the shell of a conch, which assimilates all kinds of animate, inanimate and mixed substances, cannot be changed into black; in the same way, the knowledge of the knower, who consumes all kinds of animate, inanimate and mixed substances, cannot be changed into nescience.
The same conch, when it, on its own, discards the whiteness of its shell and adopts blackness, it loses its white character.
Similarly, the knower also when he, on his own, discards his knowledge-character and dwells into ignorance, it acquires nescience.
