The soul is perceived as an extrinsic agent for the modifications of karmic bondages (knowledge-obscuring karma, etc.) and it is figuratively said that the karma has been produced by the soul.
A war is fought by the warriors, still it is figuratively said that the king is at war. Similarly it is said from the empirical point of view, that the jîva, or the soul, has produced the karma.
