The Self who drives himself away from the multitude of karmas, virtuous or wicked, done in the past, is certainly the real repentance.
And the Self who drives himself away from the future thoughtactivities that may cause bondage of karmas, virtuous or wicked, is certainly the real renunciation.
The Self who realizes as evil the multitude of karmas, virtuous or wicked, which come to fruition in the present, is certainly the real confession.
The Self who is always engaged in renunciation, who is always engaged in repentance, and who is always engaged in confession, is certainly the right conduct.
