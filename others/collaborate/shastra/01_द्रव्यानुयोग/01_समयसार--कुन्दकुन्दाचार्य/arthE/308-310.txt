A man, bound in shackles for a long time, knows the nature of his
bondage, intense or feeble, and also its duration. He cannot get
rid of the bondage till the time he is able to break the shackles. Without such an effort, he cannot get freedom for a very long time.
In the same way, the Self, while knowing the nature of the karmic bondages – quantity of space-points, species, duration, and fruition – does not get rid of these bondages (till he makes an effort). If he attains purity by abandoning attachment etc., he can get rid of all karmic bondages.
