Just as a worldly man, for the sake of his livelihood, serves a king, and the king, in return, provides him with various kinds of pleasure-giving objects, in the same way, when the Self, like a worldly man, serves the karmic matter, then karmas also, in return, provide him with various kinds of pleasure-giving objects.
Further, if the worldly man does not serve the king, then the king does not provide him with various kinds of pleasure-giving objects. In the same way, when the right believer does not serve the karmic matter for the sake of sensual pleasures, the karmas also do not provide him with various kinds of pleasure-giving objects.
