Just as a man, bound in shackles, cannot get rid of the bondage merely by worrying about it, similarly, a man cannot get liberated from karmic bondage merely by worrying about it.
Just as a man, bound in shackles, can surely get rid of the bondage by breaking the shackles, similarly, a man can get liberated if he makes efforts to get rid of the karmic bondage.
After knowing the nature of the karmic bondages and also the nature of the Self, the man who keeps at bay all karmic bondages, gets liberated.
