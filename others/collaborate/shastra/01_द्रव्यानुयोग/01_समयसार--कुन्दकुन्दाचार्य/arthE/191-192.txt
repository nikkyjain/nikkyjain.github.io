Just as gold, on being intensely heated, does not lose its inherent quality, in the same way, the Self with right knowledge does not abandon his nature of true knowledge on being burnt (by way of hardship or torment) as a consequence of the rise of karmas.
Thus, the knowledgeable Self realizes the true nature of the Self, while the ignorant, being camouflaged by nescience, gets associated with impure psychic states such as attachment.
