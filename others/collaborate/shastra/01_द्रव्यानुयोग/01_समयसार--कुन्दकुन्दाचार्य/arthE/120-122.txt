Knowledge and perception-consciousness is inseparable from the Self; however, if we consider anger too as inseparable from the Self, then soul and non-soul will get amalgamated into one entity.
This hypothesis will entail that all souls in this world will surely become non-soul too. Same misleading notion prevails if we consider karmic conditions, karmic matter, and quasi-karmic matter to be inseparable from the Self.
Therefore, to dispel this misleading notion, as we regard anger to be distinct from the conscious Self, similarly, regard karmic conditions, karmic matter, and quasi-karmic matter also to be distinct from the conscious Self.
