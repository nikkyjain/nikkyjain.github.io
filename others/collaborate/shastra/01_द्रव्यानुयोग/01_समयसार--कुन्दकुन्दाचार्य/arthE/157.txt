The Self with the attribute of attachment suffers bondage of karmas, and the one with the attribute of non-attachment (detachment) sheds his karmas. This has been declared by the Omniscient Lord and, therefore, (O bhavya – potential aspirant to liberation!) do not have any attachment for the karmas.
