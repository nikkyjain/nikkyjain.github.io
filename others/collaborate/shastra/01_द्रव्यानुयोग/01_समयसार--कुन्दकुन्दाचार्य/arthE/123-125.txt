If you believe that physical matter does not get bound to the Self on its own accord, nor does it evolve into modes of karma on its own accord, then, it becomes immutable.
Or else, if you believe that the karmic molecules (varga) do not get transformed into various karmic modes, then this belief will lead to non-existence of the worldly state of the soul (samsâra), identical with the Sâkhya system.
If you maintain that the Self transforms the karmic molecules into various karmic modes, then how can the Self cause transformation in a substance that, by nature, is immutable?
Or else, if you believe that the physical matter, on its own accord, transforms into various modes of karmas, then it will be false to say that jîva causes transformation of karmic matter into karmic modes.
Therefore, in reality, just as the karmic molecules which get transformed into various karmic modes are material substance, in the same way, karmic modifications like knowledge-obscuring karmas etc., are mutated states of the karmic substance.
