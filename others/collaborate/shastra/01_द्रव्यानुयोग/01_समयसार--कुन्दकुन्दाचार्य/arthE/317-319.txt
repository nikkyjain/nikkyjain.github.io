The Self and the karmic bondage are differentiated (and separated) on the basis of their own intrinsic nature. The karmic bondage should be discarded and the pure soul ought to be realized.
(The disciple asks –) 'How can one realize that pure soul?' (The Âchârya replies –) 'That pure soul can be realized through selfdiscrimination. As earlier the pure soul was separated from the karmic bondage through self-discrimination, in the same way, the pure soul is realized through self-discrimination.'
Through self-discrimination, one must realize that 'I' is really the 'pure consciousness'; and, further, that all other dispositions are not part of oneself.
