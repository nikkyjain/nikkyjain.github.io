Non-repentance (of past perversions like attachment) is of two
kinds. Similarly, non-renunciation (of future perversions like desire) is of two kinds. This teaching entails that the Self is not their causal agent. Non-repentance and non-renunciation are also of two kinds each – physical and psychical. This teaching entails that the Self is not their causal agent. Know that so long as the Self does not follow renunciation and repentance, of physical and psychical dispositions, till then he is the causal agent of the karmas.
