If we believe that both, the Self as well as the physical matter, transform into modes of various karmas, then both will be said to assume the status of karma. 
But only the physical matter assumes modification as a result of karmic disposition and, therefore, this modification in physical matter is distinct from the psychic modes, like attachment and nescience, of the connecting agent, the Self.
