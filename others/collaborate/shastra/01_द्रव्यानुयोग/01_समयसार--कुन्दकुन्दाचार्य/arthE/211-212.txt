In reality, the Self who entertains even a very small amount of attachment etc. (wrong dispositions), is not aware of the true nature of the soul, although he may have mastered all scriptures. And since he does not know the soul, he does not know the non-soul too. How can the one who does not know the soul and the non-soul be a right believer?
