Since the four kinds of karmic influxes (wrong belief, nonabstinence, passions, and actions of the body, the organ of speech and the mind), due to the impure qualities of knowledge and faith in the Self, cause bondages of various kinds of karmas every instant, therefore, the Self with right knowledge is free from bondage.
Since the quality of knowledge, due to its lowest stage of disposition (destruction-cum-subsidence), re-emerges, within one muhurta*, in alternative modes, therefore, this cognitive quality (from the level of destruction-cum-subsidence to the level just before perfect conduct) has been said to be the cause of bondage of karmas.
