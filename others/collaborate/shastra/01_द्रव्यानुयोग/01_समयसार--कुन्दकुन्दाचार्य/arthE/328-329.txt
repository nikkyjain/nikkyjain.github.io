Repentance (of past sins), pursuit (of virtue), abandonment (of attachment etc.), concentration, abstinence, self-censure, confession, and purification (by expiation), these eight constitute the poison-pot (because in these the soul is comprehended to be a doer).
Non-repentance, non-pursuit, non-abandonment, nonconcentration, non-abstinence, non-self-censure, nonconfession, and non-purification, these eight constitute the nectar-pot (because these forbid the soul to be a doer).
