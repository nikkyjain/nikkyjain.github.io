Attainment, self-devotion, fulfillment, achievement, and adoration are synonymous. The soul which is devoid of selfdevotion is a guilty soul. Only that soul which is not guilty is free from fear. Such a soul, knowing its true nature (pure consciousness), is always engrossed in the accomplishment of its pure nature.
