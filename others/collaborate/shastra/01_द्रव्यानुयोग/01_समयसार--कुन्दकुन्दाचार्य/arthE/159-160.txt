Anyone who has not positioned himself in the divine state of the soul, but performs austerities and observes vows, the allknowing call his austerities and observance of vows as childish austerities (bâltapa) and childish observance of vows (bâlvrata).
Those who although observe vows and rules of conduct as well as celibacy and austerities, but do not position themselves in the divine state of the soul – of knowledge consciousness – do not attain liberation.
