Know that erroneous knowledge (of the nature of substances) in the Self is the rise of nescience (ajâna); flawed conviction (in soul and non-soul substances) is the rise of wrong belief (mithyâtva), tendency not to abstain from sensual pleasures is the rise of non-restraint (asanyama), indulgence in perverted passions (like anger etc.) is the rise of passions (kashâya), and threefold activities (of the body, the organ of speech and the mind), whether meritorious or wicked, involved or uninvolved, is the rise of yoga.
As a consequence of the rise of wrong belief (mithyâtva) etc., the material substance that comes in the form of primary karmic matter gets modified into eight kinds of karmic matter like the knowledge-obscuring karma. The time when this primary karmic matter gets attached to the soul, during that period, the Self is the causal agent of his own ignorant dispositions.
