The statement that the space-points of karmic molecules pervade the space-points of the soul, or that they touch the soul, has been made from the empirical point of view (vyavahâra naya). From the transcendental point of view (nishchaya naya), the soul neither gets bonded with nor touched by the karmic matter.
