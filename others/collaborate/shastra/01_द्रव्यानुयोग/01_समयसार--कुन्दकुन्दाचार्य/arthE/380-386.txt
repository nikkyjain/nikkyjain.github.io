Just as an artisan (a goldsmith, for example), does his work to produce earrings etc. but does not become identical with it, so also the Self produces karmic matter like knowledge-obscuring karma, but does not become identical with it.
Just as an artisan (a goldsmith, for example), uses tools like a mallet to produce earrings etc. but does not become identical with them, so also the Self acts through the instruments of mind-, speech- and physical-activity to produce karmic matter like knowledge-obscuring karma, but does not become identical with them.
Just as an artisan (a goldsmith, for example), takes up tools but does not become identical with them, so also the Self adopts instruments of mind-, speech- and physical-activity but does not become identical with them.
Just as an artisan (a goldsmith, for example) enjoys the fruits of his work (earrings etc.) but does not become identical with the fruits, so also the Self enjoys the fruits of karmas (in the form of pleasure and pain) but does not become identical with them.
The above perspective, from the empirical point of view (vyavahâra naya), is worth speaking; now listen to the transcendental point of view (nishchaya naya) which is the result of the modifications of the Self.
Just as an artisan (a goldsmith, for example) makes his mind up to undertake the task (of making earrings etc.), gets engrossed and becomes one with the task, similarly, the Self also gets engrossed and becomes one with his psychic dispositions like attachment.
Just as an artisan (a goldsmith, for example), while performing the task, suffers all the time and becomes one with that suffering, similarly, the Self, kindled by pleasure and pain due to his psychic dispositions, suffers all the time and becomes one with that suffering.
