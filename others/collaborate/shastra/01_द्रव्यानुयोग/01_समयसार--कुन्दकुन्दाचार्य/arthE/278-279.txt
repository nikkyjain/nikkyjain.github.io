That I am responsible for making the other living beings miserable or happy, cause them to be bound or released, this assertion of yours is fraught with delusion, is futile, and, therefore, erroneous, for sure.
If, in reality, the living beings get bondages of karmas due to dispositions, and, treading on the path to liberation, they get dissociated from such bondages, then what is your role? (Meaning thereby that your dispositions concerning binding or releasing others are useless.)
