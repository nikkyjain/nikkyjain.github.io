Those incapable of attaining liberation, even though they may observe vows, carefulness, control, supplementary vows, and practice austerities as prescribed by the Omniscient, remain without knowledge and are wrong believers.
The abhavya (one incapable of attaining liberation), even
though he may have studied the scriptures, but having no faith in the substance (tattva) called liberation (moksha), then, not having faith in true knowledge, his study of the scriptures is of no use.
Such a person (incapable of attaining liberation), has faith in the dharma only to the extent of achieving worldly pleasures; he loves it, takes interest in it, and touches it. But for the dharma that is instrumental in dissociation of karmas, he does not have faith, love, interest or tactile-feeling.
