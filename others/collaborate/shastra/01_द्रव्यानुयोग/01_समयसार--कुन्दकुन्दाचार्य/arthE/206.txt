The right believer (due to the absence of attachment etc.), while getting involved in sensualities, really does not indulge in them, but an ignorant person (due to the presence of attachment etc.),even if not involved in sensualities, really indulges in them. This is akin to a person performing certain acts but, in reality, is not responsible for them.
