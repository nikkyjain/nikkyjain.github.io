Physical matter gets transformed into karmic matter due to soul’s passions like attachment. Similarly, jîva also, conditioned by karmic matter like delusion, gets transformed, showing tendencies of attachment etc.
Jîva does not produce changes in the attributes of the karma, nor does the karma produce changes in the attributes of the jîva. It should be understood that these two get modified as a result of one conditioning the other due to mutual interaction.
As such, the soul is the creator as far as its own attributes are concerned, but not the creator of all the attributes that are due to its association with karmic matter.
