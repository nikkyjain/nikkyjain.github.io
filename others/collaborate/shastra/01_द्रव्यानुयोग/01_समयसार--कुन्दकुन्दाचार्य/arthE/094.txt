Again, erroneous faith is of two kinds – one pertaining to the jîva or soul, and the other pertaining to ajîva or non-soul. Similarly, nescience (ajñâna), non-abstinence (avirati), actions of the body, the organ of speech and the mind (yoga), delusion (moha), and passions (kashâya) like anger, are of two kinds (in respect of being jîva or ajîva) each.
