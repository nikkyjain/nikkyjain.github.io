In the right believer, there are no influxes of attachment, aversion, and delusion. Therefore, without these psychic states pertaining to attachment etc., the existent karmic matter cannot cause fresh bondages.
Four kinds of karmic influxes such as wrong belief, cause bondages of eight kinds of karmas, and these four kinds of karmic influxes are due to the psychic states of the Self, pertaining to attachment etc. Because of the absence of these psychic states pertaining to attachment etc., the Self with right belief does not get fresh karmic bondages.
