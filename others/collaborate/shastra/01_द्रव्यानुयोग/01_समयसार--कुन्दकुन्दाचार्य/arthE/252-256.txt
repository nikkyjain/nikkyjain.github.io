A man, living in a place full of dust and with oil applied on his body, exercises with weapons like sword, dagger etc., pierces and slits clusters of trees such as palm, tam l, plantain, and bamboo, and breaks up animate and inanimate objects; think about the real reason why he attracts dust particles onto his body while performing such destructive activities.
The stickiness of oil applied on his body is the reason for him attracting dust particles; know for sure that this attraction is not due to his bodily actions.
In the same way, a wrong believer, while engaged in various activities, attracts karmic dust due to dispositions like attachment.
