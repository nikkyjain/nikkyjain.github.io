The ignorant persons who do not know the Self (soul) declare a non-Self as the Self. Some ignorant persons describe the Adhyavasana (thoughts of likings and disliking associated with wrong belief) as Jiva (soul) and some state that Karma is Jiva. 
Some identify Jiva (soul) as the intense and mild feelings in the form of Adhyavasana. Some identify the physical body (Nokarma or quasi-Karma) as Jiva (soul). 
Some believe the rise (fruition) of Karma as Jiva (soul). Based on the (wrong) notion of the ability of Jiva becoming intense and mild, some believe that the strength of the fruition of Karma is Jiva.
Some consider the combination of Jiva (which is unknown to them) and Karma as Jiva. Some believe that the association of (eight types of) Karma is Jiva.
In these and many other ways, ignorant people identify the Self with the non-self. Such absolutists are ignorant of the truth; say those who know the ultimate point of view.
