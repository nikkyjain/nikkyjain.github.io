Since from the point of view of some modifications, the soul dies, and from the point of view of some other modifications, the soul does not die, therefore, the one-sided view that the soul (that enjoys) is the same as the doer, or else, some other is the doer, is not tenable.
Since from the point of view of some modifications, the soul dies, and from the point of view of some other modifications, the soul does not die, therefore, the one-sided view that the soul (that acts) is the same as the enjoyer (of fruits thereof), or else, some other is the enjoyer, is not tenable.
The one who believes that the soul that acts is the same as the soul that enjoys is a wrong believer and does not have faith in the teachings of the Omniscient Lord.
The one who believes that the soul that acts is absolutely different from the soul that enjoys is a wrong believer and does not have faith in the teachings of the Omniscient Lord.
