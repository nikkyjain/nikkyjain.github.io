One who erroneously considers any alien object such as an animate being (wife, son etc.), an inanimate thing (riches such as gold and silver), and mixed animate-inanimate object (land, cattle etc.) as 'I am this substance', or 'It is me', or 'I am its', or 'It is mine', or 'It was mine in the past', or 'I was identical to it in the past', or 'It shall be mine in future also', and 'I shall also be like it in future', has only superficial awareness (bahirâtmâ). But one who understands the real nature of the Self does not entertain such erroneous notions and, therefore, possesses intimate knowledge (antarâtmâ).
