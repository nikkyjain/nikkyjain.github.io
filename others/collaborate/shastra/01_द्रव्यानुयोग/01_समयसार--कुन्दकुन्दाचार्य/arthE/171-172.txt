Wrong belief (mithyâtva), non-abstinence (avirati), passions (kashâya), and actions of the body, the organ of speech and the mind (yoga) are of two kinds – psychical (chetana) and material (achetana).
Psychical modifications are of various kinds and they are modes exclusively of the Self. Material modifications, like wrong belief, lead to karmas, like knowledge-obscuring karma.
The cause of material modifications, like wrong belief, is the Self when he gets involved in psychic states like attachment and aversion.
