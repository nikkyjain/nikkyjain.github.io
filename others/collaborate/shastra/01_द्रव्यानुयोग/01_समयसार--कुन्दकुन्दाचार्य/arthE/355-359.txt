If you believe that karmic matter (of the nature of deluding karmas) makes the Self a wrong believer, then your belief amounts to attributing the non-conscious karmic matter the ability to create delusion in the Self.
Or if you believe that the Self creates delusion in the physical substance, then your belief amounts to attributing wrong belief to the physical substance and not to the Self.
If you believe that both, the Self and the nature of the karmic matter, create delusion in the physical substance, then they both must enjoy the fruits of their action.
Further, your contention that neither the Self nor the nature of the karmic matter creates delusion in the physical substance will amount to attributing wrong belief to the physical substance; is it not really an erroneous belief?
