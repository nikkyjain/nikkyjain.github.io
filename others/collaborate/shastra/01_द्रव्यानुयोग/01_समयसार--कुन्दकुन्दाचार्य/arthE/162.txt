Belief in the nine substances as they are is right faith (samyagdarshana). Knowledge of these substances without doubt, delusion or misapprehension, is right knowledge (samyagjñâna). Being free from attachment etc. is right conduct (samyakchâritra). These three, together, constitute the path to liberation.
