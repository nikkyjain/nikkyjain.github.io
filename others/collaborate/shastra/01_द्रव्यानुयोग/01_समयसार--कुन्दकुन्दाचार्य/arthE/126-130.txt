If you believe that the soul by itself is not bound by karmas, and that it does not have emotional modifications like anger, then it must, by nature, remain non-manifesting.
And if the soul does not have emotional modifications like anger, then empirical life (samsâra) will cease to be, akin to the Sânkhya faith.
If you maintain that karmic matter like anger, by its own, causes emotional modifications (like anger etc.) in the soul, then how is it possible for the karmic matter, like anger, to cause modification in the soul which, by nature, is immutable?
If you believe that the soul undergoes emotional modification of anger on its own accord, then it will be false to say that the karmic matter of anger causes emotional modification (of anger) in the soul.
(Therefore, it follows that–) The soul which manifests its consciousness in the psychic state of anger is anger itself; the soul which manifests its consciousness in the psychic state of pride is pride itself; the soul which manifests its consciousness in the psychic state of deceitfulness is deceitfulness itself; and the soul which manifests its consciousness in the psychic state of greed is greed itself.
