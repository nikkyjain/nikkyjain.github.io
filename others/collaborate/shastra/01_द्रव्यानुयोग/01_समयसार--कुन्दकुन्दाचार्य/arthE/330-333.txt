The qualities that produce a substance are no different from the substance itself; like gold in the form of a bracelet is no different from gold. Whatever modifications of the soul and the non-soul have been enumerated in the scripture, know that the soul and the non-soul are no different from these modifications. Since the soul is not produced by anything whatever, therefore, it is not an effect; it does not produce anything whatever, and, therefore, it is not a cause either. Only with reference to its conditioning by karmas the soul is said to be a doer, and, as a result, karmas are produced. Only this relationship of cause-effect, as a doer of karmas, gets established.
