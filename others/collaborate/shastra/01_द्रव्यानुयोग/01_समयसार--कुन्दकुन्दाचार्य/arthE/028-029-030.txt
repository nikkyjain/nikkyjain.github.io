One with deluded intellect, thoughts, and emotions, etc., says that the bonded (physical body, etc.) and unbonded (wealth, house, etc.) Pudgala matter is mine. 
When the omniscients have seen (and shown) that a Jiva is always associated with its characteristic attribute Upayoga (Upayoga comprises of perception and knowledge), then how can a Jiva be a Pudgala (material) substance, and on that basis how can you say that Pudgala (material wealth, physical body, etc.) is mine?
If Jiva (soul substance) becomes Pudgala substance and Pudgala substance attains Jivatva (soul-ness), only then you can say that Pudgala substance is yours (but that is impossible).
