In the right believer, all previously bonded karmas, which got bonded when the Self was in the state of attachment, remain existent. They get bonded due to the manifestation of conscious dispositions of the Self, involving attachment etc.
They are existent but are not fit for enjoyment till they mature; just as a child-wife is not fit for enjoyment by the husband. The same bonded karmas, when they mature, are fit for enjoyment and, in the process, give rise to fresh bondages; just as an adult wife is fit for enjoyment by the husband and, in the process, generates his attraction. The previously bonded karmas transform from being unfit for enjoyment, to fit for enjoyment.
On becoming operative, they give rise to bondages of seven kinds of karmas like knowledge-obscuring karma (but not the life-determining karma), or eight types of karmas (including the life-determining karma).
The right believer, due to this very reason, is said to be a non-perpetrator of bondages; because of the absence of attachment etc. in him, the existent karmic matter cannot cause fresh bondages.
