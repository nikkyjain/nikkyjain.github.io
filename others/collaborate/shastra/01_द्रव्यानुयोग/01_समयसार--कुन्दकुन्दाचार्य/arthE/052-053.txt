On seeing the royal entourage, if one says, 'The king has come out', this statement is made from the empirical point of view (vyavahâra naya). In reality, only one person in the whole entourage is the king. In the same way, scriptures declare, from the empirical point of view (vyavahâra naya), that these affective states pertain to the Self, although they truly are different from the Self. From the transcendental point of view (nishchaya naya), the Self is one, different from these passions (attachment etc.).
