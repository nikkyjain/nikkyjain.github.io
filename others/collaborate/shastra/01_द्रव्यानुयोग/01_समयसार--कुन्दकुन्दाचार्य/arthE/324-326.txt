A man who commits crimes, like theft, is afraid of getting caught and arrested as he moves around. But the man who does not commit crimes, roams around in the midst of people without fear of getting caught and arrested.
In the same way, a guilty soul is afraid of getting bondage of karmas (like knowledge-obscuring karma). If the soul is not guilty, it remains unafraid of getting any karmic bondage.
