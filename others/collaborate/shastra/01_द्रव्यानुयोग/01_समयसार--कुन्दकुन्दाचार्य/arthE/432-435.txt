Ignorant persons adopt various kinds of alleged external insignia of monks and householders and claim that adoption of these insignia leads to liberation. 
But external insignia cannot lead to liberation as the Omniscient Lords, discarding all external symbols, and giving up attachment to body itself, only get immersed in right faith, knowledge, and conduct.
Insignia of monks and householders do not constitute the path to liberation. The Omniscient Lords declare that right faith, knowledge, and conduct (together) constitute the path to liberation.
Therefore, discarding all alleged external insignia of monks and householders, lead your soul to the path to liberation by immersing it in right faith, knowledge, and conduct.
