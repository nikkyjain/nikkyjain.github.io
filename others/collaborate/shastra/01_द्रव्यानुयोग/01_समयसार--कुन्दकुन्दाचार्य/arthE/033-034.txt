By worshiping the physical body made of material substance, which is different from the soul substance, a monk believes that the lord Arahanta (or Kevali) has been worshipped and adored by him.
But from the real point of view the above (worship) is not appropriate, as the qualities of the body are different from those of Arahanta. One who worships the (spiritual) qualities of Arahanta really worships Arahanta.
