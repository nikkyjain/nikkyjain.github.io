The Self, in this worldly life, is identified, point of view (vyavahâra naya), as the producer of articles such as a pot, a cloth or a chariot, besides the sense organs, various types of karmas like anger, and the quasi-karmic matter (nokarma).
If the Self is the producer of these alien substances then, surely, he shall amalgamate with them; since this amalgamation does not take place, the Self cannot be their producer.
The Self does not produce a pot, or cloth or any other substances. Only his yoga, the three-fold activity, and upayoga, the consciousness, are instrumental causes in producing the pot etc. The Self is responsible for these – yoga and upayoga.
