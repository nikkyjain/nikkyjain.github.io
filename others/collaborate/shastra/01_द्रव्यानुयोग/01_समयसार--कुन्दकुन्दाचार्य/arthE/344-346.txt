According to ordinary people, Vishnu is the creator of celestial-, infernal-, subhuman-, and human-beings. If the monks also believe that soul is the creator of six kinds of organic bodies (earth, water, fire, air, plants, and mobile beings), then there is no difference in the viewpoints of ordinary people and monks. In the opinion of ordinary people, Vishnu is the creator, and in the opinion of monks, soul is the creator. Thus, there seems to be no liberation for any of the two – ordinary people and monks – as they are ever engaged in the creation (karmic dispositions) of worlds – celestial, human, or infernal.
