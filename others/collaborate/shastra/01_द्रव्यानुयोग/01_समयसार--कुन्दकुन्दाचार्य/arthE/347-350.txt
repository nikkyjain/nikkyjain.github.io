From the empirical point of view, (the ignorant) people call the non-self substance as their own, but knowledgeable people, who know the real nature of substances, say that, in reality, even an atom of alien substance is not theirs.
A person may say that this village, town, city, or nation, is his, but, in reality, these do not belong to him; he utters such words only due to his delusion. In the same way, a person, who considers an alien substance to be his own, and then identifies himself with it, is, without doubt, a wrong believer.
Therefore, believe that these alien substances do not belong to you, and that the involvement of the Self in creation of non-self substances, as asserted by ordinary people and monks, is the view of the wrong believers.
