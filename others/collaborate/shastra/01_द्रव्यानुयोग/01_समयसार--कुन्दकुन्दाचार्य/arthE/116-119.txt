In reality, four primary conditions of influx of karmas are said to be the causal agents bringing about karmic bondage. These must be understood to be wrong belief (mithyâtva), nonabstinence (avirati), gross passions (kashâya), and yoga (actions of the body, speech and the mind).
These have been further subdivided into thirteen secondary conditions. The thirteen conditions exist, to different extent, in various stages of spiritual development (gunasthâna), from 'misbeliever' (mithyâdrishti) to 'omniscience with vibration' (sayogakevali).
These conditions of influx of karmas resulting into bondages, like wrong belief etc., are, in reality, non-conscious (achetana) because they are brought about by the rise of the karmic matter.
If these result into karmas, then the Self cannot be the enjoyer of the fruits thereof. Because the conditions called gunasthâna produce karmas, therefore, from the pure point of view, the Self is not the producer of karmas, and only the conditions called gunasthâna produce karmas.
