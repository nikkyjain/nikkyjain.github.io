The soul which shows tenderness and affection toward the three cornerstones of the path to liberation – right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct – and the three explorers of the path to liberation – chief preceptor, preceptor, and ascetic – must be understood to be a right believer endowed with tenderness.
The soul which, mounted on the 'chariot' of learning (knowledge), moves on course to the desired goal, must be understood to be a right believer, promulgating the teachings of the Omniscient Lord.
