When someone gets robbed on a road, people, conventionally, say, 'This road gets robbed', but in actual, no road gets robbed (only the traveller gets robbed). In the same way, the Omniscient Lord describes, from the empirical point of view (vyavahâra naya), the colour of the material entities of karma, and the quasi-karmic matter (nokarma), to be the attribute of the soul. Similarly, attributes like smell, taste, touch, form, body, and shape of the soul are predicated by the all-knowing only from the empirical point of view (vyavahâra naya).
