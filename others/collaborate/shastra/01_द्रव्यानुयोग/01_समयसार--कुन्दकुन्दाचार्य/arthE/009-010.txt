The jîva who, through his faculty of scriptural consciousness, realizes the pure nature of the Real Self, is called a real, allknowing Master of Scripture (nishchaya shrutakevalî) by the Rishis, the illuminators of the world.
The jîva who comprehends the entire scriptural knowledge (comprising the twelve canonical works – angas) is called an empirical, all-knowing Master of Scripture (vyavahâra Shrutakevalî) by Lord Jina. As the entire scriptural knowledge (and the resultant scriptural consciousness) is the Real Self, he is called a Shrutakevalî.
