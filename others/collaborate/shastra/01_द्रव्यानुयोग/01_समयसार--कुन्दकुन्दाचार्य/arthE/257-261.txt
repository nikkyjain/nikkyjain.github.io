Further, the same person, living in a place full of dust but after removing all oil that was sticking to his body, exercises with weapons like sword, dagger etc., pierces and slits clusters of trees such as palm, tam l, plantain, and bamboo, and breaks up animate and inanimate objects; think about the real reason why he does not attract dust particles onto his body while performing such destructive activities.
The stickiness of oil applied on his body was the reason for him attracting dust particles; know for sure that this attraction was not due to his bodily actions.
In the same way, a right believer, while engaged in various activities, does not attract karmic dust due to the absence of dispositions like attachment.
