Particles of physical matter get transformed into spoken communication containing words of censure or praise. On hearing those words you get angry or pleased thinking, 'I have been addressed thus.'
Particles of physical matter have got transformed into spoken words, and if it (physical matter) has qualities entirely different from your own, these words cannot address you. Why then, O ignorant person, do you get angry?
Unpleasant or pleasant spoken word does not beckon you and say, 'Hear me.' When the word reaches your organ of hearing, the soul does not move to apprehend the incoming word.
Unpleasant or pleasant visual form does not beckon you and say, 'See me.' When the visual form reaches your organ of sight, the soul does not move to apprehend the incoming visual form.
Unpleasant or pleasant odour does not beckon you and say, 'Smell me.' When the odour reaches your organ of smell, the soul does not move to apprehend the incoming odour.
Unpleasant or pleasant flavour does not beckon you and say, 'Taste me.' When the flavour reaches your organ of taste, the soul does not move to apprehend the incoming flavour.
Unpleasant or pleasant physical contact does not beckon you and say, 'Touch me.' When the contact reaches your organ of touch, the soul does not move to apprehend the incoming contact.
Unpleasant or pleasant quality of a substance does not beckon you and say, 'Know me.' When the quality reaches your mind, the soul does not move to apprehend the incoming quality.
Unpleasant or pleasant substance does not beckon you and say, 'Know me.' When the substance reaches your mind, the soul does not move to apprehend the incoming substance.
Thus, even after knowing the true nature (of spoken word, visual form, odour, flavour, physical contact, quality of a substance, and substance itself) the ignorant person does not achieve tranquility. He makes up his mind to acquire the non-Self and, as such, remains devoid of propitious comprehension (right knowledge).
