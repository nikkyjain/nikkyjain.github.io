There is no yoga activity (yogasthâna), no bondage (bandhasthâna), no fruition (udayasthâna), and no variations according to the method of inquiry into its nature (mârgaòâsthâna).
The pure soul has no place for duration of bondage (sthitibandhasthâna), no emotional excitement (saÉkleshasthâna), no self-purification (vishuddhisthâna), no self-restraint (saÉyamlabdhisthâna).
It has no classes of biological development (jîvasthâna), and no stages of spiritual development (gunasthâna), as all the above mentioned attributes are manifestations of material conditions.
