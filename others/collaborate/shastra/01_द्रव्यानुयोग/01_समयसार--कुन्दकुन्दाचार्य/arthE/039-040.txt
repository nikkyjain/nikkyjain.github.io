By knowing all Para-Bhava (other objects, and reflective thoughts or Bhava Karma caused by the Udaya of the previously bonded Karma) as others, one abandons them. Therefore, this knowing (Jnana) is to be considered as the abandonment (Pratyakhyana) itself. This should be understood as a rule.
Just as a person (who is honest) gives up a thing belonging to another person after knowing that it is not his, in the same way the knower of the truth (Jnani) renounces all Para-Bhava (other objects, and reflective thoughts or Bhava Karma caused by the Udaya of the previously bonded Karma) after knowing that these are non-Self.
