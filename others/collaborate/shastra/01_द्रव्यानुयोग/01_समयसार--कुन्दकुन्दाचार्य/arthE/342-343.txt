The knowledgeable does neither produce nor enjoy the fruits of various kinds of karma, but he knows the karmic bondages involving merit or demerit, and the results of their fruition.
Just like an eye, being different from the scene it is viewing, neither performs the scene nor enjoys it, similarly, knowledge, being different from the karmas, neither performs the karmas nor enjoys them. It only knows bondage, liberation, rise of karmas and their shedding.
