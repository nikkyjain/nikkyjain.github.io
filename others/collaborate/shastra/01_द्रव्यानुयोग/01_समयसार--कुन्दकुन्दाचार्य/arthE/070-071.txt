Living beings with one, two, three, four, and five senses, gross and fully developed, and their opposite, subtle and undeveloped, are classes based on their physique-making karma (nâma karma). The classes of living beings (jîvasthâna) are the result of physique-making karma (nâma karma) and since the causal conditions are physical in nature, how can these be identified with the nature of the soul?
