Since the soul is incorporeal, it is certainly non-assimilative (of food). In reality food is corporeal, comprising physical matter.
There is no attribute, acquired or natural, in the soul that it can either assimilate or discard any alien substance.
Therefore (being non-assimilative) the pure soul neither assimilates nor discards any alien substances – animate or inanimate.
