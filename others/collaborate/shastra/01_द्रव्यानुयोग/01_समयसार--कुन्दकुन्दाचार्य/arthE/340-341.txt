The one incapable of attaining liberation, even though wellversed in scriptures, does not give up his attachment for various species of karmas, like a snake does not give up its poisonous nature even after drinking sweetened (jaggery-mixed) milk.
The knowledgeable, fixed in non-attachment, knows the sweetbitter nature of the fruition of karmas; he, therefore, remains a non-enjoyer.
