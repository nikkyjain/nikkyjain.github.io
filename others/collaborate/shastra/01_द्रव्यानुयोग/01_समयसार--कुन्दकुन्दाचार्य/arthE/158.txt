Undoubtedly, the divine state of the soul is absolute consciousness (samaya), pure (free from all viewpoints, only knowledge consciousness), omniscient (having attained its innate attributes), ascetic (absorbed only in the Self), and the knower (being knowledge by itself). The ascetics who position themselves in this divine state of the soul attain liberation (nirvâna).
