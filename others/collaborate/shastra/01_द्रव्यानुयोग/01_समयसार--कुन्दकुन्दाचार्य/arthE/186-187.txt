Just as food eaten by a man, and acted upon by his digestive system, gets metabolized into flesh, bone-marrow, blood etc., in the same way, the earlier influxes of karmic matter associated with the Self of the knowledgeable, cause various kinds of fresh karmic bondages. Such a knowledgeable Self is away from the pure, transcendental point of view. (Only when the knowledgeable Self is away from the pure, transcendental point of view, he gets caught up in psychic states pertaining to attachment etc., which cause influxes and karmic bondages.)
