The Omniscient Lord has declared that psychic imperfections (attachment etc.) are the causal agents of these four psychic responses – wrong belief, wrong knowledge, non-abstinence, and actions of the body, the organ of speech and the mind (yoga).
Since the knowledgeable is free from these causal agents, he is, by rule, free from karmic influxes. Without influxes, there can be no karmic bondage. Without karmic bondage there can be no quasi-karmic matter (nokarma). And without quasi-karmic matter, the cycle of births and deaths ceases to exist.
