When the Karmas which are the cause of increase and decrease of size and stature are destroyed, the Atman who by their destruction becomes the Siddha Atman (perfect, liberated soul) does not increase or decrease, but remains equal to the body from which he acquires Nirvana--this is what the Arhats have said, and it is in this respect that the Atman is called Deha Parimana (equal to the body).
