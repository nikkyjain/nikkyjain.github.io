Know thou that which is distinct from Atman and is Jara (inanimate or non-intelligent) as Par-Dravya. The Par-Dravya consists of Pudgala (matter), Akasha (space), Kala (time), Dharma (the substance which helps in the motion of souls and matter) and Adharma (the substance which helps souls and matter in ceasing to move); all these five are distinct from Atman and are devoid of consciousness or intelligence.
