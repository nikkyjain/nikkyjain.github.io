Atman is neither Punya (virtue), nor Papa (evil); Atman is neither Kala (time) nor Akasha (space); he is neither Dharma, the medium of motion, nor Adharma, the medium of coming to rest from motion. Atman is neither a compound of Pudgal (matter), such as the body, etc.; he is Chaitanya Swarupa (intelligent), never loses his consciousness and never becomes another.
