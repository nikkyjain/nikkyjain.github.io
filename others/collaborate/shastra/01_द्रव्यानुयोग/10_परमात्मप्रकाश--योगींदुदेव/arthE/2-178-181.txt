As the body of a man who is putting on red clothes is not considered red, so the Sages seeing a red body do not consider the Atman to be red.
As the body is not considered old because it happens to be covered over with old and worn out garments, so the Sages seeing a feeble body do not regard the Atman as feeble,
As by the destruction of garments, the body is not destroyed, so the Sages hold that by the destruction of the body, Atman is not destroyed. As the body is separate from clothing, so to a Sage Atman is separate from the body.
