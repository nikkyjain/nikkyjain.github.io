That person who does not know the causes of Bandha (bondage) and Moksha (freedom or emancipation), under the influence of Mithiyatwa (false belief), makes a distinction between Punya (virtue) and Papa (evil). Such a person makes this distinction between good and bad deeds that he regards the former as beneficial to, and a thing to be adopted by, the soul, and the latter as injurious to and, therefore, a thing to be abandoned by it. But in reality with reference to Moksha they both stand on the same footing, being the causes of the bondage of Karmas. Hence the Jnani (Sage) abandons them both.
