The Niramjana Deva (pure and perfect God) has said that the Jiva (soul) gets Moksha by Vitraga (dispassionate), Nirvikalapa (undisturbed, hence perfect) and Sva-Samvadana Jnana (knowledge); he who is devoid of such Jnana wanders about in the Samsara (the world or the transmigratory condition of soul) for long.
