Victory to that Shiva-Swaroopa Kewala Bhagwana whose body is alleffulgence, who has obtained Paramatma Pada, who is Natha (Master) of Munis and who possesses that Shukla Dhyana (the purest contemplation) which leads to Moksha and which is unattainable by those who are entangled in the sensual pleasures of this world.
