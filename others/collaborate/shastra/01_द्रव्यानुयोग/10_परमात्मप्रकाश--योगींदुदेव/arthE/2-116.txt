On account of its love for oil sesamum has to bear much pain,-it is put under water, is trampled under foot and is repeatedly crushed in the oil-press. Note.--This Gatha furnishes another illustration of the principle laid down before, and the lesson taught by the Acharya is, that as love, i.e., attachment or desire, for the not-self is aght with pain and hardship, one should not allow it to deprive him of his Syabhayic bliss which is infinite, unabating and eternal.
