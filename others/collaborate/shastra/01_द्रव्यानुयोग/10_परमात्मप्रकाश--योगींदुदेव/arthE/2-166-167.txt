I have not given up Parigraha of different kindz, nor adopted Upsam-Bhava (that is, I have not renounced attachment to worldly objects and conditions); I have not known Moksha (emancipation) or the Moksha-Marga (the path of emancipation) which are dear to Yogins; nor have I practised - asceticism of which the Chinha (conspicuous sign) is to conquer the most arduous pains and which is the road to Moksha; neither have I risen above Punya (virtue) and Papa (evil) : how then can I hope to escape from transmigration ? Note.--In these two gathas also Prabhakara Bhatta regrets his indolence for not doing the things requisite for obtaining Moksha.
