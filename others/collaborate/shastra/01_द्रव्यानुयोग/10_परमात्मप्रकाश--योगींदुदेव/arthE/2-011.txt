Kewala Darshan (pure and perfect seeing), Kewala Jnana (pure and perfect knowing), Ananta Sukha (infinite happiness), and Ananta Virya (infinite power), etc.,--these highest attributes are the fruits of Moksha ; and these fruits never fall off from the tree of Moksha (i.e., they are imperishable; once acquired they do not decline); and there is no fruit bigher than these.
