He in whose mind even a tinge of Raga (attachment or desire for worldly or sensual pleasures) is left cannot free himself from the bondage of Karmas though he might know the Parmartha. NOTE.-The Jain teaching is that unless there is a unity of Samyak Darshana (right faith), Samyak Jnana (right knowledge) and Samyak Charitra (right conduct), there cannot be Moksha (salvation) to the soul. So the Acharya says here that if one possesses the knowledge of the Parmartha, i.e., of the real nature of the soul or God, in other words, the right knowledge, but has still got some desire for the worldly or sensual enjoyments, that is, he has not got the right conduct, he cannot obtain Moksha.
