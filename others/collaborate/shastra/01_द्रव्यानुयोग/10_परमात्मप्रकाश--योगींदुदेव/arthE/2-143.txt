Kala (time) is from eternity ; Jiva (soul) is also from eternity ; and the Samsara-Sagara:(ocean of transmigratory: condition of souls) is also eternal ; but godhood and Samyak tava (perfection or wholeness) can be found nowhere eise but in the Jiva (soul), that is, these are the special attributes of Jivas alone.
