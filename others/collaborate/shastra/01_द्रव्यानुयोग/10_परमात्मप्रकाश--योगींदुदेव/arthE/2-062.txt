One who entertains Dvesha (hatred or aversion) for the Deva (God), the Guru (teacher), and the Shastra (scripture), verily makes the bondage of Papa (bad or ovil Karma-Prakritees) on account of which he roams about in Samsara. By Papa (sinful thoughts, words and deeds) the Jiva (soul) obtains Narka (hell) and Tiryancha Gati (mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms); by Punya (virtue) it gets Deva Gati (type of celestial beings); by the mixture of both, it gets Manooshya Gata (human form); but by the Kshai (destruction) of both Punya and Papa (virtue and evil) it goes unto Moksha.
