Glory to those brave persons who, having fallen into the Draha (river, tank or lake) of youth, joyfully swim across it ; they alone may be said to be living; in this world of Jivas (the universe) they are good men. NOTE. -The meaning is that those persons who though young are not fascinated by sensual pleasures and who having adopted the three jewels, that is, Right Belief, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct, pass through the temptations and trials of youth (which is a dangerous period of life) with cheerful tess. Such persons, the Acharya says, deserve the highest praise.
