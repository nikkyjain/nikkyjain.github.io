By Himsa (killing or injuring) of Jivas (living beings) one falls into Narka (hell), and by the Abhaya Dana (the gift of fearlessness, i.e., the giving of protection, hence, non-injuring) one goes to Svaraga (heaven); both the paths lie open before thy eyes, choose whichever thou thinkest to be the best for thee.
