O soul! What foolishness has entered thy head that thou engagest thyself in Vyavahara (good and bad actions, etc.) which is the cause of SamsaraParibrahmana (transmigratory condition); know thy Shuddha Atman which is devoid of all Pra-Pancha (worldly turmoils) and is described by the word Brahma, and make thy mind steady.
