A saint who is devoted to the Ratan Traya (the three Jewels, that is, Right Faith, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct) has this Lakshana (distinguishing feature) in himself that he does not make any distinction between soul and soul; no matter in whatever bodies they dwell, he regards them all as equal.
