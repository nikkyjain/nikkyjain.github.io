Samsari Jivas (embodied souls) helpless by the force of Karmas, are born in different forms, families and status, and owing to their Karmas also do they wander about in the Samsara. When this Jiva becomes established: in its Pure Self, then it will not have to wander in Samsara ; there is nothing strange in this.
