A Parigraha-Rahit (devoid of attachment for the worldly objects) Jnani (sage) being immersed in meditation, bears all pleasures and pains with equanimity, that is, he does not become elated while surrounded by prosperity, nor does he feel depressed amidst adversity. He remains indifferent to both, and thus destroys his Karmas.
