Chidananda (knower and happy), Aik-Svabhava (pure by nature, having no adulteration of duality) Jiva Dravya (soul) is Chaitanya (possessing consciousness or intelligence); and the remaining five Dravyas, that is, Pudgala (matter), Dharma (the element which helps souls and matter in motion), Adharma (the element which assists in the cessation of movement), Akasha (space), and Kala (time) are Achaitanya (devoid of consciousness-or intelligence),--these six Dravyas, possessing their own Lakshanas (distinguishing attributes), are existing in the same place.
