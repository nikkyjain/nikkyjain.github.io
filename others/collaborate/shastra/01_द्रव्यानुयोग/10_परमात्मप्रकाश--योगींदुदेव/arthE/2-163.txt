When a man lives in his pure self (that is, becomez absorbed in the meditation of his pure Atman), his Moha is extirpated, his mind is killed (becomes steady), and breath stopped (that is, his breath issuing from the nostrils begins to issue from the palatal hole at intervals). Such a one gets Kewala Jnana (fuil and pure knowledge) and goes unto Nirvana.
