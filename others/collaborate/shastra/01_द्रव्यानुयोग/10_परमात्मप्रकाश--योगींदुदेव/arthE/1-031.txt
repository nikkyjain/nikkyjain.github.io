He (the Parmatman) has not got Mana (mind or heart); has no Indriyas (senses); is Gyana-Maee (embodiment of knowledge or consciousness); is without Moorti (sensible qualities); is Chaitanya Matra (pure consciousness); and cannot be known by the senses. From the Nischaya (real) point of view, these are the attributes of Atman (soul).
