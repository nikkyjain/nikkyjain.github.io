There is another fault with him who adopts the Sambhava (equanimity),--he leaves his body and alone mounts high over the world, when the soul attains Moksha, he becomes bodiless and goes to the Siddha Sila at the top of the world. This is laudable in reality, but is mentioned by the Acharya in the guise of a blame, because the world regards those who live in the self as highly selfish.
