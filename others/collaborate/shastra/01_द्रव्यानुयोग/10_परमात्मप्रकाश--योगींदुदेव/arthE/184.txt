That kind of 'Punya (virtue) which having given the Jiva (soul) kingly pomp, etc., provides the circumstances of pain for him, is not good; so say the Jinani (Sages). Good deeds which are done with a desire to gain some worldly objects or prosperity, hind the soul with such Punya Karmas as give him kingly pomp, etc., but they at the same time throw many temptations in his way, which he is not always able to resist. Therefore the Acharya says here that such Punya Karmas as those which while giving one worldly prosperity and comforts increase his sensual lusts and thus become the causes of pain in a future life, are not good.
