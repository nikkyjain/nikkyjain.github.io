0, Prabhakara Bhatta ! Know thou the Atman as Jnan-maee (embodiment of knowledge); the Atman knows the Self through the Self, and from the Nischaya point of view is equal to the Loka (the whole world) and from the Vyavahara is equal to the body in which He dwells at the time. And with reference to Jnana (knowledge) He is equal to the Loka-Loka (the whole universe).
