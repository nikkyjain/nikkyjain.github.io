He who is free from colour, smell, taste, sound and touch, that is, who is free from body and is not subject to birth and death, such a Being is Niranjana.
Know thou that Being as Niramjana in whom Krodha (anger), Moha (attachment), Mada (lust), Maya (deceitfulness) and Mana (pride) do not exist, and who is in no way concerned with meditation and the object of meditation.
One who is devoid of virtue and evil, of pleasure and pain, and is free from every sort of defect or blemish, know thou that soul as Niranjana.
