As Sphatika-Mani (crystal) being in contiguity with flowers of different colours, in appearance shows itself as red, yellow, black, etc., but looking to the real nature of crystal, these various colours do not appertain to it, the crystal in its real nature being pure white; so does the Atman being Parmatman by nature appear of various shapes and colours on account of the influence of Karmas ; in reality neither shape nor colour appertain to its Shudha Svabhava (pure nature).
