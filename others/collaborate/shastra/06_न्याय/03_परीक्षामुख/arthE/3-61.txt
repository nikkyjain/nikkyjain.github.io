The word (shabda) is with-modification (parināmī) – proposition (pratigyā); it is with-modification (parināmī) because it is a creation (krutaka) – means (hetu, sādhana); that which is a creation (krutaka) is seen with-modification (parināmī), as a pot (ghata) – illustration of infallibleaffirmation (anvaya drushtānta). The creation (krutaka) is the word (shabda) – application-of-the-rule to the case (upanaya); therefore the word (shabda) is withmodification (parināmī) – conclusion (nigamana). That which is not with-modification (parināmī) is not seen as a creation (krutaka), as the son of a barren-woman – illustration of infallible-negation (vyatireka drushtānta). The creation (krutaka) is the word (shabda) – application-ofthe-rule to the case (upanaya). Therefore it is withmodification (parināmī) – conclusion (nigamana).
