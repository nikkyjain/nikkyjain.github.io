Only in the presence of the object-to-be-proved (s훮dhya) can the instrumental-object (s훮dhana, hetu) be present, and in the absence the object-to-be-proved (s훮dhya) the instrumental-object (s훮dhana) must be absent. As: 'Only in the presence of the fire can the smoke be present, and in the absence of the fire the smoke must be absent.'
