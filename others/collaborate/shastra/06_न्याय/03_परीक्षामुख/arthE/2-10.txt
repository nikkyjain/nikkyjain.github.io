The view that 'the cause (kārana) of knowledge itself is the object-of-knowledge (jñeya)' carries with it the fault of transgression (vyabhicāra) when applied to the instruments (karaõa) of knowledge. The senses (indriya), the instruments (karaõa) of knowledge, are the cause (kārana) of knowledge but not themselves the objects-ofknowledge (gyeya); these do not know themselves.
