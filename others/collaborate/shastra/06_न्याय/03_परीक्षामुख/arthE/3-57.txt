The non-contradictory precedence (pūrvacara) and noncontradictory subsequence (uttaracara) do not exhibit invariable-togetherness (tādātmya) with the object-to-beproved (sādhya), therefore, these cannot be termed as the means (hetu, sādhana) that are the own-nature (svabhāva) of the object. Also, these do not exhibit the relationship of the cause-of-origination (tadutpatti) with the object-to-be-proved (sādhya), therefore, can also not be termed the means (hetu, sādhana) either of its effect.
