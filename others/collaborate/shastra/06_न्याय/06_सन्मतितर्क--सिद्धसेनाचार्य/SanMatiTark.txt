The following verse distinguishes Inana (knowledge) from Darsana (perception.) :- . जं सामएणग्गहणं दसणमेयं विसेसियं णाणं ।
दोण्ह वि णयाण एसो पाडेक्कं अत्थपज्जाओ ॥1॥ Perception is the cognition of the general ; and knowledge means the cognition of the particular. This is the import of the two Nayas respectively. Two points as accepted by the Jaina Doctrine are mentioned here (i) Definition of Jnana (knowledge) and Darsana (perception) (ii) Their distribution between the two Nayas. A thing is cognized by the soul either in its general form or with its particulars. This general cognition of a thing is called Darsana (perception) in Jain a terminology ; and the cognition of a thing in its particular aspects is termed as knowledge. This comprehension of the general aspect of a thing gives rise to Dravyastika (Nonmenal) standpoint ; while comprehension of the particular aspects of a thing gives rise to Paryayastika (Pheno Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 64 ] SANMATI-TARKA ( II. 2 menal) standpoint. Perception therefore goes with Dra. vyastika and knowledge goes with Paryayastika. 1. How far one and the same thing appears different at the time of its perception and at the time of its knowledge is stated in the following verse :--- दव्वढिओ वि होऊण दंसणे पज्जवट्ठिो होइ ।
उवसमियाईभावं पडुच गाणे उ विवरीय ॥2॥ At the time of perception i.e. from the Dravyastika point of view the soul appears in its general aspect. But even then (i.e. at the time of perception) it is with its particular attributes also when its quality of Upasama is concerned. Exactly otherwise does the soul appear when viewed from Paryayastika point of view; but even then, though it seems to appear with its particular aspects only, it maintains at the same time its general character also. The soul or for the matter of that, any other thing has always got double characteristic of general and particular. Now the question arises, if everything has this double aspect of general and particular, what difference is there Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ II. 2] CHAPTER II [ 65 either when it is looked at from a particular point of view or from a general point of view ? The answer to this question is given in the present verse : With whatever view-points a thing is looked at, the thing itself is the same. The only difference is this that when it is looked at from a general point of view, its particular aspect though existing all the time does not appear in bold relief at that time but remains unseen or concealed, behind the general feature. Similarly when a thing appears in its particular aspect, its general form is there all the while ; only it does not intrude upon our notice but is hidden in the background. Take for instance, the soul. Even when it appears, in its pure general form, that is to say merely as a consciousness, it has got its particular aspects (such as Aupasamika, Ksayika etc., and various other attributes) existing at that very time; only these particulars are not manifest at that particular time. On the other hand, at the time of looking at it from the standpoint of particular aspects the general characteristics of the soul such as consciousness etc., are there present--only they are not manifest at the time of looking at it from the standpoint of its particulars. In short, the particular aspect of a thing is dormant or subordinate at the time of the perception of a thing and the general character of a thing is dormant at the time of the knowledge of a thing. 2. As a rule these two cognitions-perception and knowledge-do not occur or take place at one and the same time, but even this rule has its limitation-as is made clear in the following verse : मणपज्जवणाणतो णाणस्स य दरिसणस्स य विसेसो। केवलणाणं पुण दसणं ति णाणं ति य समाणं ॥3॥ This rule of separate time for the two cognitions, perception and knowledge, holds good upto the knowledge called Manahparyaya (thought-reading of others). But in the case of the highest kind of knowledge called Kevala Jnana (the supreme or the absolute knowledge) no such separate time for perception and knowledge is necessary; for these two cognitions syncronize in Kevala Jnana (absolute knowledge). In fact at this stage, perception and knowledge are one and the same. Looking to the definitions of perception and knowledge (as is given in the first verse of this chapter ) and considering the fact that at the time of perception particular is dormant and at the time of knowledge general lies dormant, three questions arise in our mind-(1) are, perception and knowledge, the two functions of only one soul bat occuring at different times ? or ( 2 ) do these two functions of the soul occur at one and the same time? or (3) do these two perception Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

While answering to these questions, the author first states a point abont which there is likelihood to be no difference of opinion. After this he takes a controversial matter and states his point of view with reference to it. It is a matter of common knowledge that five kinds of Jnana (knowledge), and four kinds of Darsana (perception) have been enumerated in the Jaina metaphysics, 1 Out of these five kinds of knowledge four excepting perfect knowledge differ from perception in point of time, They are obviously, therefore, different from perception. From this statement which is universally accepted it follows as a matter of course that in the imperfect or Savarana Upayoga the two upayogas-perception and knowledge are mutually different. Not only that but these two take place at different times. But in the case of Niravarana Upayoga the author states his opinion as being different from that of the current Jaina tradition and says that in the case of Kevala-jnana there is no difference in time as regards perception and knowledge. Not only that but from the point of viow of Absolute or Kevala-jnana perception and knowledge are one and the same. It follows from this, therefore, that the Upayoga of Niravarana Cetana is quite different from that of Chadmasthika Upayoga and that, in consequence, the former comprehends 1 See Tattwartha : 2.9.

From the above explanation it follows that in the state of absolute knowledge, the two Upayogas viz. perception and knowledge are neither two different functions at one and the same time but one function only at one and the same time. 3, The author, now, in course of his discussion of different views of this matter refers in the following verse to the view of "the consecutiveness of perception and knowledge which is based on Agama (Jain scriptures): Huila 753711 FIUE IN T HE FIE" fai सुत्तमवलंबमाणा तित्थयरासायणाभीरू ॥4॥ Some Acaryas (Jain preceptors) who are afraid, lest they violate the command of Tirthankara the holy guide and who consequently, depend on the Sutra view of the matter say that whenever the omniscient that is the holy guide comprehends a thing that is to say knows a thing in its particular form, he does not look at the general character of the thing.

________________ II. 4 ] CHAPTER II [69 * The author here introduces one of the two current views, as regards the peculiarity of absolute knowledge. He first introduces the view of Krama-vada i.e consecutiveness and explains its import. This view maintains that in the very nature of things, consciousness is incapable of grasping the general and the particular aspect of things simultaneously. Whether it be Chadmasthika or Nira varana, therefore, the two functions of perception and knowledge are necessarily consecutive i. e. take place one after the other This view is particularly supported by the text of the Sutras. The persons holding this view being afraid to hold another view lest they would thereby float the opinion of the holy Tirtharkara who preached these sutras, set forth their view strictly in accordance with the traditional interpretation of the Sutras. In support of their view, they cite some Sutras.' : "केवली " भते ! इमं रयणप्पभं पुढवि आगारहिं हेतूहि उवमाहिं दिट्टतेहिं वण्णेहिं संठाणेहिं पमाणेहिं पडोयारेहिं जौं समयं जाणति त समयं पासइ 1 नं. समय पासइ त समयं जाणइ ? गोयमा नो तिण? समट्ठ। से केण?ण भते! एव वुच्चति-केवली ण इमं रयणप्पम पुढविं आगारेहिं न समयं जाणति नो त समयं पासति ।

When the absolute knower knows this Ratna-prabha eartb he does not perceive it (as you say) and when He perceives it, he does not know it. What is the reason of this ? Answer :-The reason is, Oh Gautama ! That his knowledge is full of forms, but his perception is formless. He, therefore, does not perceive when he knows, and does not know when he perceives. This is absolutely true in the vast range of his knowledge and perception that is to say down from the seventh earth and Saudharmakalpa upto Isatpragbhara and from the matter of ultimate atom to the molecules having infinite special units. 4.

(8) If we persist in saying that at the time of absolute perception, knowledge is not possible, and that, at the time of absolute knowledge, perception is not possible, it would mean that both have end, but this is absurd, since we already know from the Satra that both are endless). In this connection there is another view the view of simultaneousness of knowledge and perception which takes its stand mainly on logical arguments. Here the author places in the spirit of a dispassionate reviewer, this view in juxtaposition to the view of successiveness ; and asks the Sahavadi to advance arguments against Kramavadi. Advocates of simultaneousness advance these following three arguments against the Kramavadi: (1) If, by virtne of something, absolnte knowledge is possible at a certain moment, then, obviously, absolute perception also must take place by virtue of the same thing, at that moment. If complete removal of obstruction is the cause of absolute knowledge, how is it - then that absolute perception is not possible even when the removal of obstruction of perception has taken place at that very moment? The fact is that, as the unclouded sun, by its very nature, gives light and heat at the same Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

(2) As when all the Karmas obstructing knowledge are removed, in the case of Kevalin (omniscient) his Mati-jnana and Sruta-jnana and others are not different from absolute knowledge in the same manner, when the Karama obstructing perception is removed in the case of a Kevalin-it is not proper to say that even His perception appears at a time different from that of knowledge. (3) Ip the holy scriptures it is said that both Absolute knowledge and Absolute perception have beginning bat no end. Now according to Kramavada both these will bave beginning as well as end. For according to Kramavada, Absolute perception is not present at the time of Absolute knowledge and Absolute knowledge is not present at the time of Absolute perception. The Kramavada, therefore, obviously goes against the scriptures. This is what the scriptures say? : Question :-Divine Lord! Is there any duration, period as regards Absolute knower (Kevala Jnani) ? Answer :-Oh Gautama - Absolate knower even though has beginning, is imperishable, endless. 5-8 In the following verse the Siddhantavadi (author) first questions his opponent and then introduces his own viewpoint: 1 " agiat o gal 1991 !

To this question this must be the only answer that both spring forth simultaneously. In fact, both are not different from each other. In order to refute the view of Kramavadin, advocate of oneness, using the argument of Sahavadin puts a query to Kramavadin thus :-If the removal of the obstruction of both knowledge and perception takes place at one and the same time, can the question at all arise as to which comes out first.-Knowledge or Perception ? There is no reason why absolute knowledge should come first and absolute perception afterwards ? Now if the Kramavadin persists in saying that absolute knowledge comes first, then with an equal force of argument, this opponent may say that absolute perception appears first and knowledge afterwards. Besides, the Kramavadin has to answer the question as to why there should be succession at all as regards absolute knowledge and perception even when the removal of their obstruction is simultaneous ? This difficulty in the way of Kramavadin does not present itself in the case of Sahavadin, for the latter holds Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ II. 10-14 ] CHAPTER II [75 that both absolate knowledge and perception appear simultaneously. But the Author holds that even the view of Sahavadin is not logical. The Author grants that the sahavadin cannot be blamed as the Kramavadin in advancing faulty argumetos as regards the appearance of knowledge and perception, but says that Sahavadiview which holds that absolute knowledge and perception are two separate functions, is wrong. The truth of the matter is that in the state of omniscience, there is only one function. 9. In the following verses the Author charges his opponent with the following faults (in argument). जइ सव्वं सायारं जाणइ एक्कसमएण सव्वएणू ।
जुज्जइ सया वि एवं अहवा सव्वं ण याणाइ ॥ 10॥ परिसुद्धसायारं अवियत्त दंसणं अणायारं ।

सागारग्गहणाहि य णियमपरित्त अणागारं ॥ 14॥ (10) If you say that the omniscient comprehends in deeper details all physical things at one and the same time, you must admit that it is so at all times, otherwise there is no meaning in his omniscience.
Granted that the knowledge is distinct and that the perception is indistinct but in the case of a person whose knowledgeobstructions are absolutely removed there is no such thing as distinct or indistinct.
The omniscient, at all times, speaks of things unperceived and unknown-you will have to grant this and if you do so, you will not be able to account for the belief that the omniscient preaches a thing which is both known and perceived at one and the same time.
What can an omniscient know and perceive if he is said to be perceiving what is unknown and knowing what is unperceived ? If such is the case, how can he claim omniscience !
In the scriptures, both knowledge and perception are said to be endless. But if we make a distinction between perception and knowledge, the former has necessarily a limited province. The author in these verses, in order to establish his view of oneness ( of knowledge and perception ) leaves five charges with equal force against both the Kramavadin and Sabavadin. 1. Both the Kramavadin and Sahavadin hold that knowledge and perception are two separate functions. Naturally they must hold that the province of Absolute knowledge is 'the particular and that of Absolute perception is the general'. It follows, therefore, that both these functions (Absolute knowledge and Absolute perception) like other kinds of knowledge such as Mati, Sruta and others comprehend only one of the many objects. If they once accept this, they have to admit that in their view there is no function of knowledge which has the capacity to comprehend all things, in other words there is no such thing as Absolute knowledge. If this be so how can a Kramavadin or Sahavadin account for Absolute knowledge or Absolute perception ? Now to account for Absolute knowledge and Absolute perception one has to suppose that every comprehension has as its object the partial and the general aspect of the world at every moment. If this is believed, we will have also to believe in a comprehension of all things through one comprehension, to make room for Eternal knowledge and Eternal perception. While doing this the distinction between knowledge and perception will be effaced Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 78 ] SANMATI-TARKA [ II. 10-14 absolute knowledge and absolute perception being one and the same thing. 2. The only difference between Sakaragrahana and Nirakara-grabana is that the former is Vyakta while the latter is Avyakta. Now in the case of a Kevalin the obstructions being completely removed there can not be any difference between Vyakta and Avyakta for this difference is entirely due to obstructions. 3. It is said in the scriptures that a Kevalin at all times speaks of things known and perceived. This statement in the scriptures neither Kramavada nor Sahavada agrees with. According to Kramavada a thing which is known at a certain moment is not perceived at that very moment and a thing which is perceived at a certain time is not known at that very time. This being the case, according to Kramavada, whatever a Kevalin says is either known or perceived at a given time but it is not both known and perceived at the same time. Thus a Kevalin may be said to say about things unknown or unperceived. Now in Sabavada it is true that both the functions (of knowing and perceiving ) are said to take place simultaneously ; still the province of each function is strictly limited, that is to say according to Sahavada knowing concerns itself with the particulars of things while perceiving busies itself with the general only. Hence, when Kevali knows a thing he does not perceive it and when he perceives a thing, he does not know it. Thus according to this view a Kevali at all time is either a speaker of unknown things or else a speaker of unper. ceived things. Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ II. 10-15 ) CHAPTER II [ 79 4. If we, according to the view of Kramavada or Saha vada, regard two separate functions of knowing and perceiving, it follows that a Kevali perceives a phase or aspect of a thing which was unknown before, similarly he knows an aspect of a thing which was not perceived before. In other words, it would mean that for a Kevali some thing at least of a thing remains either unknown or unperceived. If this be so, how can we say that he is all knower or all perceiver ? On the other hand, a Kevalin according to these two views would mean one by whom some thing remains unknown or unperceived. 5. In the scriptures knowledge and perception are said to be endless, limitless. But if we follow these two views and regard two separate functions the limitlessness of knowledge and perception can not be maintained. For perception, because it is indistinct, has necessarily a limited province as compared with knowledge which is distinct. The view of oneness, on the other hand, is not at all open to the above-mentioned fallacies or defects since it accepts only one function and admits that the one function has the double capacity to comprehend both the general and the particular in the case of a Kevalin. And so there is no difference between Absolute knowledge and Absolute perception 10-14. In the following verse Kramavadi tries to defend himself but is finally silenced by the author : Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

To this the Author says :-As the omniscient can not be said to be the possessor of five fold knowledge so also it is the case here. This is what Kramavadi says:--Take a man who is still in an imperfect state, that is to say, has his knowledge obstructed but is a possessor of four kinds of knowledge. He deals with his functions of knowledge by turns, still as the capacity of his knowledge is ever present, he is said to have knowledge having beginning but no end, to bave eternal knowledge, to have a distinct knowledge to speak about things known and perceived ; to be both the knower and perceiver, Similarly a Kevali though dealing with his functions of knowledge in succession may be said, on account of his having the potentiality of Absolute knowedge and perception, to have limitless knowledge, perception etc. The analogy being perfect Kramavadi cannot be said to be at fault, The following is the rejoinder of Author to this :Having mere potentiality is no sufficient argument. If we regard mere potentiality as good as actual working of the power, how is it that an Arihanta is not said to be a possessor of five types of knowledge, Panca-Jnani?

All these things are limited and may yield to some sort of classification or division. (17) But in the case of knowledge, and perception of a Kevalin unlike the four kinds of knowledge no division is possible.

________________ 82 ) SANMATI-TARKA [ 11. 16, 17 It is already said in the sixth verse that if absolute knowledge and perception are regarded as having succession on the analogy of Mati, A vadbi and other kinds of knowledge-it would follow that Absolute knowledge deals only with the particulars of things while Absolute perception deals only with the generality of things. This would mean that both Absolute knowledge and perception are imperfect and partial. Now whatever is imperfect or partial can never be pergent, just as Mati and Avadhi and others in a Kevala state where the obstructions are completely removed. By the above illustration or analogy of Mati and others the Absolute knowledge wbich occars successively is proved to be open to the charge of imperfection The analogy of Mati and others is more clearly explained in the present verse. The province of Mati and Sruta kinds of knowledge is those things that can be stated, spoken or decided For both these kinds of knowledge deal with things, having limited attributes. Now Avadbi knowledge deals with Pudgala (atoms) only and the province of Manahparyaya is merely the mind-atoms It is clear, therefore, that all these foor kinds of knowledge working always in succession bave their province quite limited. Moreover. owing to suppression or annihilation of obstruction as well as owing to imperfection, there can be mutual distinction between these four kinds of knowledge But there cannot be any kind of internal difference between Absolute knowledge or Absolute perception Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

It is clearly established with cogent argument in the preceding verses that Absolute knowledge and perception are identical. There are, however, some Sutras in the scriptures which do not apparently agree with the view of oneness, nay, some of these Sutras distinctly state separateness of knowledge and perception. How to steer clear of this difficulty ? To this the Author says : -If a thing is once proved to be of a particular nature on the strength of clear proofs but is found to be stated in the Sastra in Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

In the present case the view of oneness is conclusively proved by several proofs. A wise man, therefore, ought to interpret the Sutras in such a way that they will not go againgt the established view. Those Sutras in which is stated the difference between knowledge and perception, should be considered or regarded as quoting the view of Kanada or some such non-Jaina view. These non-Jaina works. accept the succession of knowledge with regard to a person who is not a Kevalin. The Jaina Sutras obviously follow this non-Jaina view in that limited field. In the Sutra "Jam Samayam Janai" therefore, the word Kevalin should not be interpreted as omniscient (Sarvajna) bat one with absolute Sruta knowladge or Avadhi or Manahparyaya. In the case of these three kinds of absolute knowledge it is to be supposed that at the time of knowledge there is no perception and that at the time of perception, there is no knowledge. 18 In the following verse, the author removes all the doubts as regards his own view: जेण मणोविसयगयाण दंसणं णत्थि दव्वजायाण ।

Absolute knowledge and perception are one, but in practice both the words Jnana and Darsana are used. Now the question arises:--lf in the case of Absolute knowledge both the terms Jnana and Darsana are accepted to point ont one and the same thing for all practical purposes, why not so in the case of Manahparyaya ? Why not say both Manahparya ya Jnana as well as Manahparyaya-Darsana ? To this the Siddhanti gives the following answer :- The object of the fanction of Manahparyaya is the mass of the atoms of mind. But the peculiarity of this function: of Manahparyaya is that it takes its objects always in their particular aspect and never in their general aspect. As, therefore, the substances that are the objects of ManahparyAya are always comprehended in their particular aspect it is named in the Sastras as 'Knowledge.' The case of Absolute knowledge is altogether different. Though it is one, it is comprehended in two-fold ways-in its general as well as its particular aspect. It is therefore gaite proper to use the words Jnana and Darsana with reference to Kevala Jnana. 19.

From this division we can say that Jnana and Darsana are different, It is by the force of argument already proved that Kevala Jnana is one and one only. How is it then that it has been the practice to speak of knowledge and perception as being different? The reason is similarly this that it has been so stated in the Sastras. In Jain Sastra among the fonr divisions of Darsana, Kevala Darsana is mentioned to be one. But if it is said that Kevala Jnana and Darsana are really different, since it is so distinctly stated in the Sastras, we reply no. Whatever Sastra may say, it has been incontrovertibly proved that Absolute knowledge and perception are one but they are said to be different not because the cognitions are different but because the objects of this knowledge are two-fold viz., general and particular. 20 The following two verses describe the partial view (Ekadesi) : दसणमोग्गहमेत्त 'घडो' त्ति णिव्वएणणा हवइ गाणं ।
जह एत्थ केवलाण वि विसेस एत्तियं चेव ॥21॥ दसणपुव्वं णाणं गाणणिमित्तं तु दसणं णत्थि ।

(22) Perception necessarily precedes knowledge but knowledge never precedes perception. It can, therefore, be definitely: asserted that, in a Kevalin, knowledge and perception are not different from each other. There is a third party man who regards knowledge and perception as identical, but gives another illustration to prove his point, which the Siddhantin does not approve of. He, therefore, introduces this view of the third party in order to refute the illustration : This is what tbe third party says : The function of Mati is only one but its preliminary stage namely that of Avagrada (indistinct) is nothing but Dars una and the next or final stage such as that of appre. hending the thing fully is called Jnana In other words the same Mati function in its lengthy process is named two-fold. In its primary stage when the object is indistinctly apprehended, it is called Mati Darsana and in its latter stage owing to the distinct apprehension of objects it is. called Mati Jnana In exactly the same manner Absolute knowledge is fundamentally one, but owing to the differ.

It is as follows: It is everywhere accepted that Jnana- knowledge, always follows Perception-Darsana. Now if Jnana and Darsana in Kevalin are different, this role must hold good even in the case of a Kevalin. That is to say, even in the case of a Kevalin, Kevala Jnana ought to be regarded as following Kevala Darsana. It cannot be so regarded. This can never be, for as all the Labdbi (spiritual acquisitions) are already obtained as knowledge of the forms (Sakara-upayoga). The beginning of Kevala-labd hi also takes place with Sakaropayoga. But if this is admitted we have to suppose Darsana as following Jnana which is simply absurd. For the usual rule is this that a Jnata first apprehends things in their general form and afterwards in their particular form, 21, 22. Following verses examine the illustration given by the Ekadesi objector. जइ प्रोग्गहमेत्त दसणं ति मण्णसि विसेसिश्रणाणं ।

________________ [ 89 II. 23, 24 ) CHAPTER II (23) If you say that all Avagraha is Darsana and comprehending the particulars of a thing is jnana (knowledge) then it follows that Mati-jnana alone is Darsana (perception.) (24) The same must be said of all the rest of the senses as regards Darsana. But this is absurd. Now if in the case of objects of other senses, only knowledge is accepted the same must be accepted in the case of the objects of sight. The Siddhanti agrees with this partial objector as regards identity but the Siddhanti does not agree with the illustration given by the Ekadesi. He therefore subjects the illustration to a searching analysis and in order to show his disapproval of the illustration shows to what absurdits the acceptance of the illustration will land the Ekadesi. The Siddhanti points to the objector his absurdity. He says "If you regard the portion of Mati namely Avagraha as Darsana and regard the comprehension of particulars as Jnana, it would follow that the case of the sight Caksasa vagraba-mati will have to be regarded as sight-perception. The same will be the case as. regards other senses. . That is to say Avagraba Mati with regard to the sense of hearing will have to be regarded as ear-perception and Avagraba-mati with regard to the sense of smell will have to be regarded as smell-perception. But in Sastra there is no such thing as ear-perception or smell. Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 90 ] SANMATI-TARKA ( II. 25 perception is mentioned. On the other hand ear-know. ledge or smell-knowledge are terms found used in Sastra. Now if you say, sight-perception is the only thing accepted in Sastra then we say why this partiality in the case of sight perceptions. The proper thing, then, is to deny Caksu-darsana in the case of the sense of sight along with the senses of hearing and smelling Unless you accept this position, you cannot account for Caksidarsana and Acaksu-darsana. Either you shall have to accept Darsana impartially in the case of all the senses (not in the case of Caksu alone) or you shall have to give up the idea of accepting any such thing as Caksu-darsana. On the whole, it is difficult for yon to account for the two terms- Caksu-darsana and Acaksu-darsana--as are found in the Sastra." 23, 24. In the following verse the Siddhanti defines clearly the term Darsana thus : णाणं अप्पुट्ठ अविसए य अत्थम्मि दंसर्ग होइ। मोत्तूण लिंगो ज अण्णागयाईयविसएसु ॥ 25॥ Darsana is that kind of knowledge which takes place as regards things untouched and which do not come within proper province. This cognition does not admit in its fold that knowledge which takes place by virtue of Hetu (the middle term) as regards things that are to happen in future and other things. Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ II. 25 ] CHAPTER II [ 91 The Siddbanti on his part is accosted by the objector thus:-If the two functions namely Jnana and Darsana are not regarded as separate and if the Avagraha portion of Mati be pot regarded as Darsana how are you going to account for the fact that in the Sastra the two terms Caksa-darsana and Acaksu-darsana are used in the sense of two different functions ? To this, the Siddhanti answers thus : - Yes; we say that Jnana and Darsana are not two different functions. To say that A vagraha portion of Mati is Darsana and thus to account for the use of the term Darsana is, we think, not quite proper. Still we think Sastra is quite right in using the two terms in different senges. This does not go contrary to the supposition that the two fonctions are identical. Our definition of Darsana is this: That knowledge which takes place through the medinm of Caksu without touching its objects and through the medium of mind is called Caksu-darsana and Acaksu-darsana respectively. The knowledge proceeding from inference is of course to be excluded from this defini. tion According to this definition, knowledge of remote objects such as the sun or the moon, not actually in touch with eye but springing through the medium of eye is called Caksu-darsana. And the cognition of subtle things such as an atom or other things apprehended through mind is called Acaksu-darsana, Cognition springing from mind alone (and not from any other senses falls under the head of Acaksu-darsana, From this it follows that only two senses are such that they do not actually touch the objects which they perceive and Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 92 ] SANMATL-TARKA ( II. 26 that the two kinds of cognition from these two senses are respectively called Caksu-darsana and Acaksu-darsana. There is a subtle distinction between these two kinds of cognition. It is this that while all the cogntion proceeding from the eye which does not touch its objects is called Caksa-darsana--all the cognition through mind with regard to objects that are not perceived by senses is not necessarily A casu-darsana. For instance, though cognition by inference is with regard to objects not perceived by senses, it is not to be regarded as Acakspdarsana. It is for this reason that cognition by inference is expressly excluded from tbe definition of Darsana. That inference about past and future things which takes place on the strength of Hetu such as for instance--the inference of rains in upper regions on seeing the floods of a river in lower regions or the instance of an impending rain by seeing the clouds overcasting the sky, or the inference of fire in a kitchen by seeing the smoke issuing from it are all such kinds of cognition as deal with objects not apprehended by senses but by mind ; still they are not called Acaksudarsana. The long and short of this is Acaksidarsana means no more than conceptual judgment through mind. 25. Over-absurdity (Atiprasanga) avoided :मणपज्जवणाणं दसणं ति तेणेह होइ ण य जुत्त ।
भएणइ गाणं णोइंदियम्मि ण घडादयो जम्हा  ॥ 26 ॥ According to the aforesaid definition Manahparyaya is Darsana ; but it is not so. Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ CHAPTER II II. 26 ] [ 93 It is laid down that proper province of this knowledge is Mind which is technically called No-indriya. The jars etc. are excluded from its sphere, . If this definition of Darsana 'Only that cognition which is neither begotten from the contact with nor comprehended by sense-organs is Darsana (Perception)" be adopted, Manah-paryaya Jnana will have to be termed Darsana, because Manah-paryaya Jnana takes cognizance of or say appertains to the things such as jars etc. 'as thought out by the mind and at the same time those objects are not physically associated with or touched by the soul or mind. Admission of Ista patti (proving what is to be proved) also would not do here because there is not a single reference in the whole of the canonical literature to the effect that one may be led thereby to believe Manahparyaya as Darsana. Now how this anamoly should be dismissed ? To meet this objection it is said that this is not a real hitch in as much as it is wrong to say that Manahparyaya Jnana concerns only with those things as thonght out by mind. The real business of Manahparyaya consists in knowing the molecular change of the particles of mind and not the things .such : as jars etc. One with a Manahparyaya does think of the things as thought out by other's mind but he does that through inference. First he knows the mind-particles and this he knows directly. Then he infers and through infer Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 94 ] SANMATI-TARKA [ 11. 27 ence he comes to know of the things as thought out by the mind-particles of other people. This means that if there is anything on which the Manahparyaya has a legitimate claim, it is the mindparticles and not the things as alleged by the objector. Moreover, it is never the case that the mind particles of other people are not touched by Manahparyaya Jnana because those mind particles are nothing bat the members of the same category called mind which is always in touch with the soul which is the recepient. Thus they being similar are in constant touch with the soul. So Manahparyaya can be clearly excluded from Darsana. 26 Further explanation regarding accepted arrangement : मइसुयणाणणिमित्तो छउमत्थे होइ अत्थउवलंभो। एगयरम्मि वि तेसिं ण दसणं दसणं कत्तो ? ॥27॥ In the case of Chadmasthas, Mati and Sruta-jnana are the two things responsible for arriving at a cognition of categories. If there is nothing like Mati-darsana or Sruta-darsana, how then Darsana is at all possible ? On one hand it is logically established that Joana (knowledge) and Darsana (Perception) are different Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ II. 28 1 CHAPTER II ( 95 because the arrangement that only that process of knowledge which goes by the name of Avagraha is styled Darsana is also not free from flaw. While on the other hand understanding in the case of Chadmasthas is possible only if the presence of Mati and Sruta is granted. Now if Darsana is not believed to exist either in Matiupayoga or in Sruta-upayoga, Vyavahara cannot be justified. Therefore, we arrive at a conclusion that the definition of Darsana ontlined just before holds good. 27 Why Sruta-jnana is not Darsana ? जं पञ्चक्खग्गहणं ण इन्ति सुयणाणसम्मिया अत्था ।
तम्हा दसणसहो ण होइ सयले वि सुयणाणे ॥ 28 ॥ The term Darsana cannot be applied to sruta-jnana because the things conceived by sruta-jnana cannot be directly conceived. The definition of Darsana is only that the cognition which is neither begotten from the contact with nor comprehended by sense-organs is perception. According to this definition Sruta-jnana is also Darsana because its objects are not all necessarily touched by sense organs. How can it be said, then, that the term Darsana cannot be applied to Mati or Srata ? This objection can be met with by saying that Sruta-jnana no doubt comprehends objects not touched by the sense-organs but it does this only indirectly. While the aforesaid definition of Darsana enjoins direct comprehension: This means, in Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

तम्हा श्रोहिण्णाणे दसणसहो वि उवउत्तो ॥ 29  ॥ There can be also Avadhi-darsana because by Avadhi-jnana things though untouched are directly comprehended. It means that as there is Avadhi-jnana there is also Avadhi-darsana. There is no objection in believing the existence of Avadhi-darsana because it can see directly the Paramanus which the sense-organs cannot necessarily see and comprehend. So the definition of Darsana does include Avadhi-darsana. 29. Both Jnana and Darsana can simulta. neously fit in with Kevala-upayoga which is only one : जं अप्पुटे भावे जाणइ पासइ य केवली णियमा ।

________________ [97 II. 31 ) CHAPTER II perceives and knows the objects simultanecously. A perfect being perceives and knows directly the whole universe in its particular and general form. At the same time that whole universe is not touched whole to whole to his Soal-Particles. So His comprehension of the universe is a direct one and arisen without the actual touch of His sense-organs with it. Hence this comprehension can be equally, though relatively, expressed by both the terms jnana and Darsana. That comprehension is Jnana because it knows its particular elements and the same is Darsana also because it sees its general features also. So the Upayoga the common offsprings of which are jnana and Darsana is one throughout. Hence it is illogical not to believe in Ekopayoga-vada. 30 Contradiction evidenced in Canonical literature avoided : साई अपज्जवसिय ति दो वि ते ससमयओ हवइ एवं ।
परतित्थयवत्तव्वं च एगसमयंतरुप्पाओ ॥ 31 ॥ According to real Jaina doctrines both Jnana and Darsana have a beginning but no end, This being the case a doctrine which formulates that there is an interval of one Samaya between the productions of both of them should not be accepted as a real Jaina Doctrine. Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 98 ) SANMATI-TARKA [ 11. 32 It is logically proved that they are identical but the contradiction which is still there in the Canonical Literature is to be reconciled. Because when an omniscient sees, he cannot know and when he knows, he cannot see. In short, he cannot see and know at one and the same time. Such a statement which is found in the Sacred Books has got to be clearly explained. It has been logically proved once for all that one and the same Upayoga is responsible for both Jnana and Darsana. And that represents the true doctrine of the scriptures. When this doctrine is accepted as a standard doctrine every other is to be taken only relatively. So the doctrine which preaches succession and not the simultaneity of jnana and Darsana is not the real Jaina doctrine and every other doctrine is non-jaina in its implication. It is not the case always that in a sacred literature of a particular creed, those doctrines only are described which are favourable. Sometimes the doctrines belonging to other creeds are also incidentally described, disproved and discarded. So the doctrine of Kramavada (succession of jnana and Darsana) is to be taken as belonging to the other creeds. 31. * Explanation of Darsana when used in the sense of faith : एवं जिणपण्णत्ते सद्दहमाणस्स भावओ भावे। पुरिसस्साभिणिबोहे दंसणसहो हवइ जुत्तो ॥ 32 ॥ Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

(33) When there is Samyag-jnana, there is Samyag-Darsana always but the converse is not true. The word Darsana as used in the Jaina scriptures is a technical one. It has got two special meanings. One meaning of it is Indistinct consciousness (Nirakara Upayoga) and the other is Faith (Sraddha). As regards its first meaning, the author while recording his protest, has establisbed its real meaning. According to him the meaning of Darsana is not Nirakara Upayoga which is totally different from distinct knowledge (sakara Upayoga). But the knowledge can be from another point of view also styled Darsana. In the same way he differs from others as regards its other meanings also. What he means clearly is this that Samyag-darsana which is one of the three instruments ensuring emancipation is not according to him different from Samyag-jnana. In other words Samyag-jnana is Samyag.darsana. However, it is Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 100] SANMATI-TARKA . 34-36 a question, which of the Samgag-jnana can properly become Samyag-darsana. To this he replies that Darsana is that process of knowledge which is firm in faith (Apaya) regarding Jaina scriptures. Sam yag-darsana , he goes on, is a particular kind of inclination (Ruci) which is never essentially different from knowledge (Mati jnana) that is based upon genuine, unshakable belief in things taught by Jinas. This leads us to believe that the word Darsana as aged in Darsana-varana and Darsana-mohanlya at the time of describing varieties of Karmas, is not to be taken in the sense of Darsana but in the sense of jnana. It is no doubt true that Samyag-jnana is Samyagdarsana but all Darsana is not always Samyag-jnana because Darsana which is one-sided cannot claim to be Samyagojnana. It should touch all the facts of a thing. So it becomes established that Samyag-darsana as it is grounded on Anekanta can claim to be called Samyagjnana. Therefore one who wishes to obtain Right Faith (Samyag-dasrana) should simply try for the acquision of Versatility of Aspects (Anekanta). 32-33.

It mears, then, Kevala is destroyed. (36) Moreover, this Artha-paryaya, which is just like absolute knowledge, comes into being in the form of Siddhatva. With reference to Kevala-Bhava the sutra declares that it is without an end. Sadi means with a beginning that is to say it is produced ; Aparyavasita means without destruction that is to say endlese.

According to Jainism, such a Padartha as has no origination, destraction and permanence, is never existent. Kevala Paryaya, being a Padartha, must have prima faci all the three above-mentioned characteristics. Cor. poreal peculiarities such as a particular bent of body etc. in a Kevali when he has a body, vanish when be gets Siddhi. * The bodily' pecaliarities which appear at the time of the body's existence do also indicate those of the soul because between them too there is a milk and water relationship. When it stands thus, it means that when the body with a partioular condition is destroyed the soul which had had a parallel condition is also des-troyed. Now the soul is Kevalarupa and when the soul is destroyed as proved above, it also means that the Kevala is also destroyed. Moreover, the very soul now became Siddha thus giving rise to a new Siddha-paryaya.

This means clearly that both Kevala-jnana and Kevala-darsana are not merely Sadi (with a beginning) bat Saparyavasita (with an end) also. Moreover, even though Jhana-Darsana-paryaya. undergoes origination and destruction every moment, it is still one and permanent in the form of Kevala. Thus it is endless. This smoothes down a contradiction in the Shastras that they are Aparyavasita. They are Saparyavasita and Aparyavasita both strictly in the senses mentioned above. To sum up, Kevala-bodha as it comes into being only once, is no doubt, Sadi, and because it undergoes modificatory changes and remains stable also, it is Aparyavasita 34-36. .

________________ 106 1 SANMATI-TARKA ( II. 37-42 Just as a sixty years old man who becomes a king at the age of thirty, is styled " This man became a king "; so also a soul fit to get emancipation is beginningless in the form of a soul but when it gets perfect knowledge, we say, " This soul became Omniscient." The man of the example is the same throughout but a modificatory change of his not being a king is now gone and in its place a modificatory change of his being a ling has come into existence. So also in the matter under discussion, soul wbich was there persists throughout. A modificatory change of his not being Omniscient is now gone and in its place a modificatory change of his being an Omniscient has appeared. At both these places, as there is no distinction between a modificatory change, and a general' the origination and destruction of modificatory change are construed as origination and destruction of general.' Thus we are entitled to say :-"This man having first ceased as a not-king has now become king " and " This soul having first ceased as 'imperfect being has now become an Omniscient." In other words, general even though it is permanent throughout, is destroyed as a previous modificatory change and has come into existence as posterior, modificatory, change. This establishes identity between Dravya and Paryaya. It can never be exclusively said that a Dravya remain as a Dravya throughout If the case stands like that, we will have to believe that Jiva-dravya as such will be one throughout.

Without difference or dissimilarity, there cannot be numerical diversity in modificatory changes also and therefore Bheda (non-identity) as between Dravya and Paryaya should be Sastrically believed in just as Abhieda. In short, Dravya and Paryaya are somewhat Bhinna and somewhat Abhinna.

________________ 110 ] SANMATI-TARKA [ III. 1-2 Everyday affairs are based on knowledge. The proof of the validity of knowledge is that our daily intercourse that is based on knowledge must be in itself valid. Real knowledge is the only means of determining the true nature of a thing. All the highest generaliza. tions as well as the middle generalizations such as Sat (reality), Dravya (substance) always asgume the form of particulars in one form or the other, when they come into the province of our daily life. Now this everyday dealing of ours cannot be said to be wrong. It must, therefore, be supposed that over and above the general, there is such a thing as particular, But all the same this general and particular are not mutually exclusive. They are one and the same thing. It is clear, therefore, that the general and the particular are interwoven in each other and the particular stands on the same level as the general. Everything, therefore, has two aspects one general and another particular and these two aspects are mutually indivisible. . If we suppose that there is nothing except the general and that there is no such thing as particular, we shall be forced in everyday dealing to give up all the particulars of a thing and to accept only its general aspect, for instance, all the transformations of gold such as bracelets or ear-rings that are real in our daily life and that are actually experienced by us shall have to be given up and every time we shall have to deal with gold as gold and nothing else, no varieties or transformations of it. If on the other hand we accept only the particulars of gold such as bracelets and ear-rings and eliminate the Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

The truth is that exclusive acceptance of the general only or particular only would land us into utter confusion. Our experience tells us that in a language no words are competent enough to signify merely the general or merely the particular, They are mutually interdependent. Though, therefore, they are separate from each other they are also identical. 1-2, The following two verses explain the meaning of the word Pratitya-vacana that is words that are considered as authentic : : पच्चुप्पन्नं भावं विगयभविस्सेहिं जं सम्मरणेइ। एयं पडुच्चवर्यणं दव्वंतरणिस्सियं जं च ॥3॥ दव्वं जहा परिणयं तहेव अस्थि त्ति तम्मि समयम्मि ।

(4) Because although the present change of a certain thing apparently has not any relation to the changes of that thing in past Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 1.12 ) SANMATI-TARKA [ III. 3-4 or in future still the truth is that the present change has definitely a relation with the past and future changes of that thing. Those words that give a correct idea of a thing are technically called in Jain sastras "Pratitya-vacana." The same words are otherwise said to be the words of a reliable person (Apta-vacana). If we want to change a gold ear-ring into a necklace and if that gold ear-ring was formerly a bracelet it is obvious that all these three varieties or transformations of gold are different from one another. They are however, identical from the standpoint of gold which is the original or underlying substance in all transformations. From this illustration we can lay down the general proposition that though the particulars of a certain thing (at different times) are different from one another looking. at them from the standpoint of a particular, they are at the same identical with one another for the substance underlying all these particulars is one and the same. This being the truth, words that denote the relation of a certain change in the present with another change in the past or the future must be regarded as reliable words for they give the most correct idea of a substance and its various particulars. What is true about the changes of a thing at all times. is also true of the changes at all places. For instance, a black cow at a particular place appears to be different from a white cow at another place. But in truth both Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

Thus if there are words that find oneness in things apparently differing from one another, those words are reliable because they establish oneness ancong things widely different from one another. 3, 4. The following two verses explain as to how the attributes of existence as well as of non-existence are possible in one and the same thing : परपज्जवेहिं असरिसगमेहिं णियमेण णिञ्चमवि नस्थि ।

A thing becomes fit for our daily intercourse only on the strength of its peculiar form. This peculiar form of the thing is all its own and is quite clear. It is neither of the nature of existence nor of non-existence. This peculiar nature of the thing is here expressed by its double nature of "is" and is not." A thing definitely " is not" .from the standpoint of the particulars of other things and definitely " is " from the standpoint of its own particulars. Those particulars which create the sense of " otherness" are the particulars of other things, while in things of the same class come both the Vyanjanaparyaya and Artha-paryaya. Out of these two Paryayas a thing " is " from Vyanjana-paryaya point of view, while from Artha-paryaya point of view. a thing " is not". An illustration in point will make this clear. An ear-ring which was formerly a bracelet and which is to be changed into a necklace in future" is not from the standpoint of a bracelet as well. as a necklace. It ** is not" even from the standpoint of things that exist along with the ear-ring but are altogether different from the ear-ring such as a jar, a piece of cloth etc. That gold which has assumed the form of an ear-ring is referred either as existent (Sat) or a substance or gold or even an ear-ring. Now in our daily life all the possible individuals which can be referred to by a word come under the category of Vyanjana-paryaya.

When, therefore, we say that an ear-ring comes under Vyanjana-paryaya we mean that all the ear-rings in the world or all things supposed to be ear-rings or mentioned as ear-rings are identical for all bear the same name ear-ring (kundala). In the same manner the one particular ear-ring that I mention will remain as an ear-ring as long as it does not change its form. As long as all the things are referred to by the same word "ear-ring" and create an idea of oneness on account of their being mentioned by one and the same word they are identical The same is the case with one ear-ring. From its production up to its destraction it is one and the same ear-ring as it is referred to by the same word and creates an idea of oneness. . . . But this is true of a thing or tbings as far as they are mentioned by a word. But if we go beyond the province of words the case is different. For when we look at the ear-ring from the standpoint of time, we must admit that an ear-ring in the present state is really different even from its former and future states. All the ear-rings may appear identical with one another owing to the fact that all are mentioned by the same word ear-ring; it may also be granted that an ear-ring is the same in past present or future so long as it does not give up its own form of an ear-ring; but it cannot be denied that when we look at things from a real viewpoint they appear different from one another. And this is non-existent from the viewpoint of the current of similar modificatory changes. Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

Not only that but two ear-rings existing at one and the same time are different from each other from the standpoint of peculiar individual difference granting that both the ear-rings are made of gold, both are shaped as ear-ring, both have the same yellow colour, the same softness and other attributes, it must be said that both the ear-rings are different from one another. In the first place, the portion of gold in each is obviously different, moreover though the yellowness and softness in both appears to be exactly similar yet there is always some sort of difference at least in the yellowness or softness of both. There are infinite degrees of yellowness, softness or any other quality. There is, therefore, at least a very small difference in degree as. regards the attributes of things. 5, 6. The following verse says that both difference and sameness can reside in one and the same person : कोवं उप्पायंतो पुरिसो जीवस्स कारओ होइ। तत्तो विभएयन्वो परम्मि सयमेव भइयव्वो ॥7॥ A person, who on account of his passions in the present life, which becomes a cause of his future life is obviously different from Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

But on the other hand the person who exists at present will be the same person in his next birth. From this point of view, therefore, the person in his present as well as future life is identical. A man who is entangled in the meshes of worldly life, himself creates his future life. It is, therefore, proper to think that the person in his present life is different from that very person in his next life. For as we have already said cause and effect are different from each other. But as the same person assumes another form in his next birth the individual soul underlying is the same. From this point of view of the identity of a soul the person is one and the same. Just as a lump and jar are also identical as much as earth is common to both of them. Similarly when a person is under the influence of passions such as anger and others, he becomes the cause of his future life which is shaped according to the effect of his passions and from this point of view the two persons in two lives (present and future) are different from each other.

For 1 In the original Gatha, there is a word Kecit meaning "Some." Here that meaning is accepted which is meant by the commentator. It cannot be said with reference to what Jaina learned men the commentator has applied the term of Swayuthya. Perhaps the works of such Jaina learned men must be before the eyes of the commentator as believe, like Vaisesikas, that attributes are different from the substance.

Moreover the characteristics of both the substance and its attributes are different. A substance is a repository of qualities and movement.

(11) But in as much as Lord Mahavira, in various sutras addressed to Gautama and Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ III. 9-15 ] CHAPTER III [ 121 others, has fixed the comotation of Paryaya and has explained that word, it must be said that the real thing is Paryaya that is to say Gunas are not different from Paryayas. (12) Paryayas are those that subject a thing to various transformations and Gunas are those that make a thing assume various forms. Both these words are synonyms but the words are not interchangeable for the word Paryaya is propagated by Lord Mahavira, but He has not used the word Gunastika. (13) Some say that in Agamas the transformation of colour is mentioned as onefold (Eka-guna) black, tenfold black, infinitefold black. It is therefore clear that there is a difference between Guna and Paryaya. (14) To this the author replies :-The word Guna when applied with reference to colour as well as the degree of colour is used to show the number of peculiar transformations. It does not signify, Gunastika. Here the word Guna is purely numerical and nothing else, Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ SANMATI-TARKA 122 ] [III. 9-15 (15) As tenness is common in ten things or tenfold one thing. In the same manner we should understand in the case of one fold, twofold black etc. Before starting a discussion as to whether there is any difference between a substance and a quality, it is proper to decide whether the word Gana as used in Jaina Sastras is used in the sense of Paryaya or whether it is used in a sense other that that of Paryaya. Out of these two alternatives the one acceptable to our author is this that the word Guna is not used in the sense of any other quality than Paryaya itself. Looking to the use made of the word Guna' by Lord Maha vira in Jaina Sastras, it seems that He has used the word Guna as absolutely a synonym of Paryayas (attributes of a thing) and that in His opinion, there is no difference between Gana and Paryaya. The reason for this is that Mahavira has divided the Nayas or viewpoints into only two Dravyastika and Paryayastika. If he would have regarded Guna as different from Paryaya and as an attribute residing in a thing then He would have mentioned a third Gunastika-naya viewpoint over and above the Paryayastika-naya. But in Sutras of the Agamas, Lord Mahavira while addressing his disciples such as Gautama and others. has used the Paryaya along with the words. Varna, Gandha etc. and thus formed the words Varnaparyaya Gandhaparyaya and explained them. He has used the words Varnaguna, Gandha-guna nowhere and has never used the word Guna in reference to Varna. It is therefore Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ III. 9-15 ) CHAPTER III ( 123 quite clear that in the opinion of Maha vira the sense of Guna is Paryaya and nothing else. Beyond Paryaya. there is no attribute of a thing. If we look to the etymology of the two words Guna and Paryaya we find that they are absolutely synonyms : Paryaya means the changes in the Dravya either consecutive or simultaneous, and Guna means assuming of different forms on the part of a thing. Thus really there is no difference in the sense of the word Guna and Paryaya. Lord Maha vira, however, has used the word Paryayastika. He has used the word Paryaya with reference to the attributes of a thing, such as a Varsa (colour) and Gandha (smell) Rasa (taste), etc. In this reference he has nowhere used the word Guna. It is therefore quite clear that there is no such thing as Guna. apart from Paryaya. Here an opponent who believes in the difference between Guna and Paryaya protests by saying that with reference to colour in Agamas the word Guna is used in words such as Eka-guna-syama etc. It seems that Mahavira, therefore, has used the word Guna and that the word is different from Paryaya in its sense. To this the author replies by saying that the word Guna is not used by Mahavira in the sense of any attribute such as colour etc. He has nowhere used the word Guna along with the words Varna, Gandha etc. Now the word Guna as used. in the Eka-guna, Dasa-guna or Ananta-guna black denotes the degree of blackness of the same type. It is not used in the sense of attributes but to show the difference in degree between attributes of the same class thus this Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 124 ] SANMATI-TARRA LUL ( III. 9-15 word Guna is a technical word used in mathematics in the sense of degrees either more or less when one attri. bute of a thing is compared with the same attribute differing in degree. Ten different things are referred to as ten things, similarly if a thing is ten times bigger than other things it is referred to as 'tenfold' (Dasaguna). In the second of this two cases there is only the additional word Gana. But the idea of 'ten' is the same. In the first case the word ten is used to express the number ten which resides in the substance. In the second case the substance is one but the word ten along with the word Gana is in order to express tenfold degree in the measure of the quality of the substance. In other places similar to this we come across expressions such as the atom is one-fold (Eka-guna) black, tenfold black, infinitefold black, the word Guaa is used no doubt but it does not mean any thing else than the attributes of a substance, in fact it is only a synonym of Paryaya. There the word Gana is used to denote the difference in degree either in point of superiority or inferiority. In short the word Guna is not used in any other sense than Paryaya or attibute of a substance. It does not denote any Dharma (quality) other than Paryaya * Thus it is established beyond doubt that in Jaina Sastras all the attributes of a substance are mentioned by the word Paryaya and that the word Guna is only a synonym of Paryaya.

For Guna is a synonym of Paryaya and Paryaya or attributes are of the nature of substance. A substance on the other hand is of the nature of attributes. The soul is of the nature of knowledge or of tbe nature of perception. Similarly a jar is red or yellow, in all these dealings it is obvious that the quality and the substance having that quality are identical. Once we accept the identity between substance and its Paryaya, it is needless to say that Guna (quality) and the substance are identical..

For, a person who is a father to one cannot be a father to all, (18) Just as a man though of the same form appears to be different from the standpoint of different persons, in the same manner the same substance when perceived by different persons appears to assume different aspects such as colour etc. That is to say it is mentioned as various particular things or attributes.

Nothing absolutely or dogmatically can be said in this matter. Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ * III. 16, 22 ) CHAPTER III; ( 129 From the discussion in the preceeding verses it has been finally, decided that the two words Guna and Paryaya, are synonyms. . But the main question still remains as to whether Guna and Dravya that is quality and substance (as has been regarded by some) are absolutely identical, The author before giving his verdict in this matter asks the person who believes in the absolute identity of a substance and quality to refute the opinion of difference between a substance and quality. Now the Ekanta-Abheda-vadt instead of advancing arguments against the Bhedavadi simply says that the opinion of persons who regard the nature of substance and quality as different from each other has already been refuted in the beginning of this chapter (Gatha 1-2) the only thing that now remains to be done is to give an apt illustration to show that absolute identity between substance and quality is the only right view.. The illustration has already been once given- that of a person who is regarded in various capacities by various persons. One person regards this particular person as his uncle but that does not mean that he is uncle to every body. Another person regards him as his father but that does not mean that he is father to every body, He assumes different relations to different persons, no doubt, bat is one and the same from the standpoint of 'a man;' all the different relations are but mere illusions with regard to that one persistent individuality of the person. Similarly substance is originally one general thing but when it comes in contact with different senses it assames the different forms of colour, Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 130 ) SANMATI-TARKA 'smell etc. In reality only the substance is true while all its various particular aspects being due to external causes are illusory. What are, therefore, Paryayas in Jain Sastras and what are in ordinary parlance called Gunas are fundamentally not at all different from the substance. In fact the supposed difference between them is not real. * "The view of absolute identity is not accepted by our author who takes his stand on the view of Anekanta (manysided nature of things). He neither subscribes to view of absolute difference on the one hand, nor to the view of absolute identity on the other. But as the view of absolate difference has already been refuted by persons holding the view of absolute identity, here the author deals with the view of absolute identity and establishes that the view of absolate identity is also wrong being one sided and that the truth lies in the middle that is between a substance and its quality there is both a difference and identity, The soundest argument against the view of absolute identity is this that if we consider that all the particulars of a substance are regarded as false and as due to merely external causes, we can not account for the degrees of intensity or otherwise as are found in the particulars or qualities. For instance, we find that even in the quality of blackness or sweetness there are different degrees. Sone things are utterly black, some are slightly black ; some things are sweetest ; other are slightly sweet. Now if the qualities of a thing or a substance are merely illusory or if the qualities are due to merely external Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ III, 1 CHAPTER III ( 131 causes such as the senses then this difference in degree of quality would not have existed at all. Even in the illustration of a person cited above if the person is only real and his different capacities are all illusory, then how is it that the same person is sometimes said to be father and greater than another person and sometimes smaller ? We must therefore admit that over and above the general thing, there is such a thing as particular which must be regarded as true along with the general: these particulars do not spring ont of the relations with external things but are merely brought out clearly by them. That does not mean that we should not at all recognise these particulars. Now if we regard these particulars as false or illusory and eliminate each particnlar at every stage, there will come a time when we shall have to eliminate the substance the general' thing for divested of its particulars no general thing can ever stand, can ever exist. The word Samanya signifies that the substance is nniform and one; the words uniform' and 'one' are relative terms The fact is that both the substance and the quality are true and different from each other, but at the same time both are also identical. To say that both of them are absolutely identical is therefore quite wrong... Here the advocates of the view of absolute, identity would perhaps argue that if every thing stands in some relation to some thing then by stretching the proposition to its logical extremity we may as well say that owing to the multiplicity of relations there is multiplicity in the thing itself, Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 132 ] SANMATI-TARKA [ III. 16. 22 To this the reply given by the agthor is this : It is true that a thing is referred to in various ways owing to various relations with other things. For, instance the same man is referred to as staff. holder if he has got a staff in his hand and book-holder if he has got a book in his hand. But how are you going to accouut for the different degrees of sweetness, blackness, etc.? True it is that black colour is a quality which becomes manifest by the contact with the sense of seeing but we can not deny that there is such a quality as black which is true' by itself. Otherwise we cannot account for the various degrees of blackness. It must, therefore, be accepted that along with the thing or substance the quality is also true and that both these are different as well identical with each other. * Now if an objection is raised against this by saying that if we regard Paryayas or particulars as true, we shall be confronted with the difficulty of regarding that contrary particulars :reside in one and the same thing. For instance, the same thing would have both heat and cold (two diametrically opposite qualities) residing in it which is absurd. To this the author says that these contrary qualities reside in one thing no doubt but they can do so if there is difference of time, place and other factors. Sometimes the thing has got such an inherent nature that two contrary qualities may safely reside in it. There is, therefore, no difficulty in thinking that qualities are real and that sometimes diametrically opposite qualities reside in a thing.

(24) If qualities are regarded as absolutely different from a substance they are either corporeal (Murta) or incorporeal (Amurta). If they are corporeal then Paramanu (an atom) which is a substance and in which qualities are said to reside will also be corporeal for it is a repository of corporeal things. But the universally accepted characteristics of an atom is that it is incorporeal; while on the other hand qualities are regarded as incorporeal then they will never be known. The definitions cited above are objected to by our author for the obvious reason that the definition would be proper only if substance and quality are different from each other. But in reality the two are not mutually exclusive ; substance like quality is subject to birth and destruction, on the other hand quality is also stationery or permanent like the substance. The definitions, therefore, are not complete. They are partially true. The perfect definition would be that in which there is the combination of the characteristics of substance and quality brought together. Such a perfect definition is given by Umaswati in his Tattwartha Sutra 5, 29. According to Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

None of the above two definitions apply to Sat for they are based on the view of absolute difference. After showing that the above two definitions of Bhedavadi do not cover the whole truth onr author proceeds to show the hollowness of the view of absolute difference in another way. He asks his opponent whether qualities (Gunas) are in his opinion corporeal or incorporeal. If qualities are corporeal then the substance which is the repository of qualities and which is separate from the qualities must also be regarded as corporeal and if it is corporeal there is no possibility of its being Atindriya (beyond the reach of senses). Not only that but in that a substance will never be of the nature of an atom. If on the other hand qualities are incorporeal then they will never be perceived by senses but in the case of jar and other things contrary is our experience. Thus qualities cannot be regarded as corporeal or incorporeal in its independent capacity. Qualities, therefore, must be considered as identical with the substance. Then alone the double nature of qualities would be accounted for by saying that where the substance is corporeal, its qualities are also corporeal and where the substance is incorporeal, its qualities are also incorporeal. The qualities of an atom, for instance, are beyond perception for atom is Atindriya and the qualities of a jar, a piece of cloth etc., are per. ceivable by senses since the things in themselves are perceivable by senses. 23, 24 Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

The synthesis of these two extreme views is the peculiarity of the doctrine of Anekanta.: 25, 26 .. The foliowing two verses show the allembracing range of this doctrine of Anekanta : भयणा वि हु भइयव्वा जइ भयणा भयइ सव्वदव्वाई। एवं भयणा णियमा वि होइ समयाविरोहेण ॥ 27 ॥ णियमेण सदहंतो छक्काए भावो न सद्दहइ। हंदी अपज्जवेसु वि सद्दहणा होइ अविभत्ता  ॥ 28 ॥ (27) As the doctrine of Anekanta shows all possible sides of a thing and thus does not postulate about a thing in any fixed way, in the same way Anekanta itself is also subject to this possibility of other side that is to say, it also sometimes assumes the form of onesidedness (Ekanta). The author admits that thus Anekanta may also become Ekanta if it does not go against the right view of things. * (28) For instance, a man who pins his faith on the six Kayas does not really show Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 138 ) SANMATI TARKA the right sort of faith. Because thereby a sense of unity is imposed on disunity. : Anekanta is a means of right knowledge. As it is used as regards all other things it is used sometimes with reference to itself and thus it makes its own position also quite clear. When it is used with reference to a certain thing it looks at the thing from all possible sides and tries to harmonize all these sides and places them in their right place. It takes a man to the real nature of a thing. Let us take an instance in point and try to show the utility of the doctrine of Anekanta. There are at present many views current with reference to the two fundamental elements in this world namely the Jada and Cetana. Some say that the two are identical or nonidentical ; some say that the two are eternal ; some say that they are both of them epbemeral ; or some that they are one or many. Now to harmonise all these views and to assign proper. place to each of the above views is the mission of Anekanta. It creates a harmony among all the warring views and thus gives the right view of every thing. Thus it says that Jada and Cetana are identical from the stand-point of general and are different from the standpoint of particular. So also in the case of eternal and non-eternal, one and many. Thus it creates a harmony between the opposing qualities of identity and difference by assigning a right place to each characteristic. Now if Anekanta shows all possible sides or characteristics of a thing we have to admit that Anekanta will Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

But if that single point of view is in keeping with the trae nature of a thing, there even Aneka nta may sometimes become Ekanta. Thus Anekanta guards us from holding opinions that are based on views that are one sided and extreme and that under the cloak of Anekanta really maintain onesided views. The thoughts in Jaina Sastra are really based on Anekanta. If instead of knowing their nature of many-sidedness, a man lapses into one-sidedness, his viewpoint is wrong. The following two instances are typical. There are according to Jaina Sastra six classes of worldly beings. Now to think that there are only six classes neither more nor less is an extreme view and should, therefore, be discarded. The fact is that sentient beings are also one from the standpoint of Caitanya. And similarly various statements of the Sastras such as " Soul is one and souls are many" are synthesized. .. Similarly every kind of killing is violence and as such is a sin. Now to think that this is an absolute truth is wrong. For we know as a fact that if a sage inspite of his being quite vigilant and extremely cautious inadver. tently kills any being it is not at all violence. Some. times, therefore, killing is also non-violence. We must therefore suppose killing is sometimes violence and sometimes non-violence. Thus we should subscribe not to extreme one sided views even though they are stated in Jaina Sastra. 27, 28 Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 140 1 SANMATI-TARKA [III, 29, 31 The application of the view of Anekanta in respect to objects ( Prameyas ) is illus. trated in the following verses : गइपरिगयं गई चेव केइ णियमेण दवियमिच्छति ।

But though it is in motion from the standpoint of going up, it is also not in motion considering that it does not move downwards. (30) Similarly fire is fire because it burns. Dahana means one that burns i.e. fire. But in some cases fire cannot burn things that cannot, by their very nature, be burnt. Thus fire both burns and does not burn. - (31) From the standpoint of a mere substance a jar does exist, but from the standpoint of sentient thing it does not Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ III. 29, 31 ) CHAPTER TIL: ( 141 exist. Similarly a sentient thing is not a thing from the standpoint of a jar.' By having recoarse to Anekanta, a man knows how to analyse things. He knows how to reconcile seeming contradictions in a thing. Thus Anekanta is, a sure means to arrive at the true nature of a thing. To elucidate this point, our author cites three illustrations, piz., that of a thing in motion, of fire and a jar. A thing in motion is so only in one direction at a given time. It cannot be, therefore, in motion in all directions. Naturally therefore it is not in motion considering the direction in which it is not moving. The two seemingly contradictory statements that a thing is and is not in motion are thus quite true from the explanation given above and thus these statements therefore are easily reconcilable. Though apparently it seems that motion and non-motion are contradictor* things. * Fire burns fuel and sometimes it is also a thing that does not burn, for it can never burn the sky, the soul and other incorporeal things. It, therefore, both burns and does not burn. These seemingly contradictory statements are relatively true, thus the many sidedness of a thing as postulated by the doctrine of Anekanta is perfectly justifiable. The same argument applies to wind also. . Similarly we can say a sentient thing is a positive thing being a substance but it also does not exist from the standpoint of definite form and other concrete qualities, or in other words Jiva exists from the standpoint Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 142 ] SANMATI-TARKA .34 of Caitanya but does not exist from the standpoint of concrete qualities such as form and others. A jar on the other hand exists from the standpoint of modification of Pudgalas (atoms) and does not exist from the standpoint of Caitanya. Thus the view of Anekanta harmonises all the seeming contradictions in a thing and represents a thing in its true nature and perspective. 29, 31. The following verses state different kinds of creation and destruction of a substance : उत्पात्रो दुवियप्पो पोगजणिो य वीससा चेव ।

Artificial creation is known by the names of Samudaya-vada and ApariSuddha. ... (33) Natural creation is also of two kinds:-Samudaya-krta . and Aikatvika. Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ III, 32, 34 ) CHAPTER III [ 143 Aikatvika creation (or rather onesided creation) is seen in Akasa, Dharma and Adharma. It is due to external causes and is not seen invariably. (31) The same is the case with destruction. It is of two kinds natural and artificial. It is also found in Samudayakrta creation in two ways. One is in the form of separation of aggregates and another is a destruction which is in the form of assuming quite a new form. According to theistic doctrines that believe that God has created this universe, every creation or destruction whether it be natural or brought about by the efforts of man is due to the will of God. Jaina Sastra does not accept this view. According to those who believe in the theory "God is the sole cause" (Isvara-karana-vadi), the production and destruction of any new thing, brought about with or without the effort of worldly beings, are to be attributed to God's effort because they are dependent only on it. Jainism does not accept this theory and to show that the author says that the production and destruction of all things do not result simply from effort. Because the theory that God is a doer does not hold good, It is proper to say in terms of our daily experience that those productions and destructions should be said Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 144 ) SANMATI-TARKA [ 11. 32, 34 arising from effort (Prayatna-janya) where there is an effort and where there is no effort they should not be said resulting from effort. Therefore it comes to this that the production and destruction of a product are either arising from human effort or not. That is to say they are either artificial (Pragogika) or natural (Swabhavika). To believe, just like Vaisesikas, that they are simply effort-produced goes against experience. A detailed nature of production and destruction is given below: It is called an aggregational production (Samudayikautpada) when disjoined members of a body unite. It is this very production which is styled a "body" (Skandha) in Jaina, philosophy and an "aggregate" (Avayavi) in Nyaya philosophy and others. This production is also termed "Impure production" (A parisuddha) as it does not belong to ope particular substance. In the same manner, it is called an aggregational destruction when it is with reference to a "body" or with regard to an "aggregate". Both the aggregational production and destruction are possible only in the case of corporeal bodies and not incorporeal ones because for their existence they are dependent on a physical body or a new product (Janya.. skandha) and such a physical body, in its turn, depends on atoms (Pudgala). Moreover, incorporeal substance has no Janyaskandha. Aggregational production and aggregational destruction are both artificial (Prayogika) and natural (Vaisrasika). The production and destruction of physical bodies such as a jar and a cloth are called artificial - aggregational production and destruction, Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ III, 32-34 ] CHAPTER III [ 145 because human effort is responsible for both of them. While the aggregational production and the aggre. gational destruction of a cloud and of a mountain are designated natural aggregational production and destruc. tion for they depend on none for their existence or extinction. That is called a single production or destruction which is confined to only one thing or which takes place without first assuming the form of a physical body by mixing with it. That production or destruction is called "puro" because it does not depend on a physical body for its existence. Incorporeal substances can become the subject of such a production or destruction and especially amongst incorporeal substances, those which are one single entity as a whole. And therefore only such a production or destruction is possible in the case of Akasa, Dharma and Adharma. Moreover snch a production or destruction is simply natural and never artificial. Because the abovenamed three substances cannot give scope to effort as they are, unlike atom, devoid of the power of motion in spite of the fact that they undergo a modificatory change. The production or the destruction of these three substances is or can be simply this that they disinterestedly become or do not become a canvas or a receptacle and passive instruments in effecting motion or stability from the view points of Time and Space for the atom or the soul which has the dynamic power. Such a production or destruction is indefinite or unconditional as it has to depend on others. 10 Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only * www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 146 ] SANMATI-TARKA ( III. 32-34 Special ? point to be noted regarding destruction is this that an aggregational destruction - both artificial and natural-is of two kinds, namely, one arising from a disjunction or division of an aggregate and the other results when a thing assumes another state. It is called a destraction brought about by the disaniting of an aggregate when different members making an aggregate disunite or leave out the composite physical body. An example illustra. ting an artificial aggregational destruction is that of a building which when broken by a human effort has its component parts namely bricks disunited. An example showing natural aggregational destruction is that of a cloud or a mountain the comprising elements of which disunite naturally without any human effort. The destruction which is called Arthantarabhava. praptivinasa -it takes place only then when a thing transforms leaving aside its former state as a physical body without a disjunction of its component parts. The example of the artificial aggregational destruction of this second type is the transformation of a wristlet into an ear-ring and that of natural aggregational destruction of this second type is the transformation of snow into water and that of water into air etc, etc. brought about by the physical phenomena or seasonal effects. Here a doubt arises as to why the productions and destrnctions-both artificial and natural-taking place in the modificatory changes of the liberated souls and I For a detailed explanation see Tattvartha Bhasya Vrtti 5. 29. page 383.

In solution of this doubt the author, it seems, has to offer two opinions. The discussion of artificial and natural production or destruction is made here chiefly against the theory "God is a door" and therefore those substances only are here considered behind the production and destruction of which God's power to do is supposed by some to exist. And therefore atom (Paramana) or any sentient substance is not touched here. Because one believing in the theory of God's power to do does not believe that an atom or a sentient substance is a product (Janya-Dravya). Vaisesikas believe that anything consisting of component parts is produced by God and Aupanisada system of philosophy recognizes Akasa to have been produced by God. And therefore an atom which represents corporeal substances and soul which represents incorporeal substances have been excluded from discussion here. A substance which is a composito physical bod y forms the central part of the discussion here. An atom is not at all a composite physical body. Soul, just like , kasa is no doubt one endless physical body consisting of Pradesas, but the discussion about its production and destruction is not done here because it occurs in the seventh verse. It itself creates its own condition and therefore the production and the destruction of its modificatory changes are artificial in view of its own effort to create them. 1 For this see Tattvartha Bhasya Vitti pp, 389-390) Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

The definition of Sat consists of a synthesis of these three viz, origination (Utpada) destruction, (Nasa) and permanence (Sthiti). The object of the writer here is to point out very clearly that time-limit of Utpada (origination) is and also is not different from that of Nasa (destruction) and Sthiti (Permanence). So also a Trinity namely Utpadada, Nasa and Sthiti is and also is not different from Sat (Abstract Entity). Nature of everything is twofold:- Noumenal and Phenomenal. So the real nature of a thing consists in taking a synthetic view. Some of the Paryayas (modificatory changes) being mutually contradictory occur successively while some of them being non-contradictory occur simultaneously. With reference to two Kramavarti Paryaya (occurring successively), then, the time of Utpada (origination) and Vinasa (destruction) is, say, one and the same becange the final time-unit of the former Paryaya anarks the beginning of the latter Paryaya. But if with reference to any single Paryaya when we think of Utpada and vinasa we find they are Bhinna-kalina (occurring successively), because the time of the beginning and end of any single Paryaya is different. But a thing remains somewhat stable even when any single Paryaya exhausts giving rise to a new one. Looking from this point of view, Utpada, Vinasa and Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ 150 ] SANMATI-TARKA . 35-37 Sthiti -all these three are simultaneous occurrances. But when a stability or permanence of a Dravya is thought of, say, from a view-point of any single Paryaya, wo shall find that the time of Sthiti is different from that of Utpada and from that of Vinasa also. In other words, Prarambha-samaya (the time of origination), Nivsttisamaya (the time of exhaustion) and Sthiti-samaya (the time which connects Prarambha and Nivstti) all these three shall be felt taking place successively. This is more clearly explained through the example of 'Finger.' * Finger is a thing which when bent cannot remain erect and vice versa. Straightness and crookedness of a thing take place successively. The origination of "straightness" (Saralata-paryaya) means the destruction of "crookedness" (Vakrata-paryaya). They both are the results of one and the same action taking place at one and the same time. And at the same time" Finger" is permanent (Sthira) as a finger. This establishes the fact that Utpada, Sthiti and Nasa are Sama-kalina, that is to say, they occur at one and the same time. Now, contrary to that, if we take only one Paryaya, namely crookedness (Vakrata) or straightness (Saralata) we are able to accomodate a different time limit for each of the three Utpada, Sthiti and Nasa. When the finger ceases to be crooked and becomes straight, from that very moment Saralata-paryaya begins. Vakrata-paryaya begins when the finger loses straight condition and assumes crookedness. And Sthitisamaya remains in force from the moment it becomes straight upto the Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

Utpada, Sthiti and Nasa (all these three)-Bhinnakalsna (occurring at definite intervals) or Ekakalina (occuring simultaneously)--as we saw above, are themselves different from or one with the Dravya of which they are the Dharmas (properties). They are different because they are its constituents and they are not different also because they don't claim a separate existence being all included in the Dravya. If we want to understand a particular Dravya with reference to past, present and future, we should do so in this manner. Let us take the example of a building. When it is in the process of building we think that the whole building is being built but it is not so really speaking because some portion of it is already built while some is still to be built. In the same way the building is Vigacchat in the process of destruction) because the constituting parts such as bricks etc are giving up their loose condition; it is Vigata (destructed) as far as its completed part is concerned, because the loose condition of its constituting parts is already destructed; it is Vigamisyat (about to be lost) so far as the incomplete part is concerned because the destruction of loose condition of the constituting parts such as bricks etc., is still to take place. Thus all the tbree states can be very well accomodated. Thus going deeper into details, three conditions namely Utpadyamana, Utpanna and Utpatsyamana can be a established regarding every destruction (Vigama) and vice versa.

A very important point to be remembered here at this stage is that when we want to adjust Utpada, Sthiti and Nasa in one particular Dravya, we should take modificatory change of the substance (Dravyaparyaya) or the modificatory change of the attribute (Guna paryaya) to illustrate them because the pure Dravya or the pure Guna shall not be able to make room for them. When the aforesaid Utpada, Sthiti and Nasa are to be adjusted with reference to any single Dravya-paryaya? or Gunaparayaya, that very Paryaya is first of all singled out and treated as an independent entity different from all the Paryayas of a similar or a dissimilar character. This is only the way to understand Reality in its particular aspect. 3537 Discussion of Dravyotpada according to Vaisesika: दव्वंतरसंजोगाहि केचि दवियस्स बेंति उप्पायं ।

(42) Origination of a Dravya is the result of modifications of Sarira (body), Manas (mind), Vacana (speech), Kriya (action), Rupa (form), Gati (motion), Samyoga (conjunction), Bhedana (disjunction) and Jnana (knowledge).

They do not believe in a modificatory change (Rupantar) of the component particles and also they do not believe in the production of a new Dravya Vaisesikas are Arambhavadi. Their favourite dogma is tbat a newly produced substance is neither a Parinama (as Sankhyas believe) nor a Samuha (as Bauddbas believe) bnt a novel substance altogether, brought about by so many causes. Jaina philosophy recognizes all the three theories but only in a way acceptable to it. It has something to say against Arambhavada of Vaisesikas and it is referred to here by the author. Arambha means a production of a new substance, which is Aporva (not latent in the mother substance). Such an Utpatti (production) is believed by Vaisesikas to be due only to combination. In other words a small or a large Dravya is produced, if at all it is 1 Jain Philosophy gives a technical name of Skandha (Physical body) to a new product. Still however it also recognizes the physical body as a transformation (Parinama), an aggregate (Samuha) and a compound (Avayavl). Because according to it, it is one and the same thing to be transformed into a physical body or to be so arranged as to give rise to a particular aggregate or to result into a compound thing.

According to them, the pieces of the pot when it is broken are not the direct products brought about by Vibhaga (disjunction or breaking'. But the process is somewhat like this. First of all the disunion of elementary (Arambhaka) Paramanu takes place, yielding separation of Dvyanukas wbich finally brings about the destruction of the pot. Now all the Paramanus which are in a disunited form again unite and the result is the pieces. The author differs from this dogma of Utpatti the very soul of the Vaisesikas. The author's contention and his own' theory are as follows : A new prodnct comes into being by the disunion of constituting elements just as their union gives rise to a new product. Speaking in different terms, combination (Sa mnyoga) and separation (Vibhaga) both are equally capable to yield a new product. This is also supported by our daily experience. To say that Samyoga only can bring about a new product has then no meaning. Just as a union of two Paramanus causes a Dvyanuka, a union of so many Dvyanukas does a Tryanuka and so on and so on, so also it is consistent to say that separation (Vibbaga) in Tryanuka produces Dvyanuka and that of Dvyanuka causes Anus etc. This proves that Samyoga and Vibhaga are equally authorized to beget a new product.

Bheda-Pratiti (experience of distinction) and Bhedavyavabara (usage of distinction) establish the theory of origination of new products as we see in the case of pieces after the breaking of Ghata. Therefore, the argument which proves Samyoga-janya Dravyotpatti also holds true for Vibhaga-janya Dravyotpatti. Counting one Utpada, one Vinasa and one Sthiti per one Samaya, we can say that a particular Dravya can make room for infinite Ut padas, Nasas and Sthities in infinite time. But how can we account for the fact that one Samaya can produce infinite Utpadas etc.? To meet this objection the author says that one Samaya can and does produce innumerable Utpadas etc. He says. that when Sahabhavi Ananta paryaya (innumerable modificatory changes occurring simultaneously) take place in one Samaya and in one particular Dravya the innumberable Utpadas of the Uttaravarti-paryaya (Paryaya which succeeds) and the innumerable Nasas of the Purvavarti-paryaya (Paryaya which precedes) do take place.

In the same fashion, Jnana (knowledge) and Virya-visesa (vitality) even though they are the properties of soul they cannot assert themselves without the Pudgala. When the Pudgala undergoes a perceptible or imperceptible bodily modification in a worldly being, the Padgalas of the mind and the speech undergo a change likewise ; Kriyas (actions) such as Kayika (bodily) etc., take place in the numberless Atmapradesa on account of the close relationship between body and soul ; Paryayas such as Rupa etc. also undergo a change ; Karmic bondage (Karmabandha), responsible for the coming life as well as new combinations and disjunctions of Paramanus occnr.

In one, Faith predominates while in other, knowledge or intellect. Sometimes Faith prevails while other times Intellect has also her days.

The author says that some part of the Canon is governed by Ahetuvada while some by Hetuvada. Ahetuvada is one which makes an exposition of subjects where there is no scope for Pratyaksa (Direct knowledge) or Anama na jnana (Inference) but which are to be taken as granted because their exposition has been made by the Canon. And Hetuvada is that which enunciates those subjects which come within the grasp of Pratyaksa or Anumana and the belief in which does not necessarily demand any Faith Ahetuvada requires Faith and the things taught by it are to be accepted only on the ground of Faith and it refuses to be acted upon by intellect or logical reasoning as long as final divine knowledge does not unravel the whole mystery. And where there is any possibility of Hetuvada, intellect and reasoning should be allowed full play and then faith should be developed. Thus an imperfect being should train intellect on one hand and faith on the other and establish identity between them, narrowing down their differences and distances. Having done accurate analysis of Hetavada and Ahetuvada the author, through a following example, states that two classifications of Bhavya and Abhavya which are self-evident form the proper province of Ahetuvada because no reason is adduced as to why all are not merely Bhavya or merely Abhavya. No logical resoning can find out a proper cause for such a state of 11 Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

Any intellect will have to fumble to account for this arbitrary classification. There is only one remedy and that is to say that it is the nature of the Jivas and such a nature can be known only by the Omniscient seers. Thus any words or sentences describing this arbitrary division should belong to the Ahetuvada section of the Canon. In the sanne way, Sadharana-vanaspati (vegetation which has only one physical body, but many souls) which contains Anantajivas (innumerable living organisms) and Pratyeka (Vegetation having one body and one soul) which contains one living organism also form part of the same Ahetuvada. Having been fully convinced of the Sastric classification of Bhavya and Abhavya and its characteristics when one begins to infer that this Jiva is Bhavya because it has got the merit of Samyag-darsana (right vision) and once it will surely put an end to this worldly cycle, Hetuvada begins. Moreover, it is also the beginning of Hetuvada when one infers that a Padgala is Ajiva because there is no Jivatva (essential characteristic of a Jiva). He only is entitled to rightly understand and propagate the Jaina Doctrine who, having first understood the limitations and demarkations of Ahetuvada (the legitimate province of Faith) and Hetuvada (the legitimate province of Intellect) employs logic and intellect where they are needed or goes to Faith.

Jiva has got Asankhyata (numberless) Pradesa, every individual Pradesa (cell or inolecule) has got a certain type of structure, the relationship between Karmas and Jiva is from times immemorial, one and the same body contains infinite Naigodika Jivas -- all these and such like dogmas are grounded exclasively on Ahetuvada.

In other Tattvas such as Asrava etc. Hetuvada takes us a good way but Ahetuvada steps in to solve the final difficulty. At the time of the exposition of every Tattva, then, limitations of both the Vadas (systems) are to be first borne in mind. This is the only method to convince the audience.

Three things are principally mentioned here regarding Naya-vada (A system of Nayas meaning methods of looking at a thing). Result of pure and impure Nayavada, the possible number of heresies and their basic principles as well as distribution of herosies into Nayavada-all these are touched here. A thing conceived by a Pramana (Right knowledge) bas innumerable attributes. Pramana is a synthetical or a collective view, while Naya represents or makes a representation of every point (cognized collectively by Pramana) severally. So it reveals only a partial truth. Parisuddha Naya (Pure Naya) is that which while engaged in exposing its specific point never touches a fact which belongs properly to another Naya. It busies itself with the exposition of a particular Ansa (point) over which it only has a claim. In short, its exposition is not based on the refutation of rival points but on complete indifference towards the other. A parisuddha Nava vada (impure Naya) is just the reverse. Thus Parisuddha Nayavada Nayas pure and simple never comes in conflict with tlie other Nayas and therefore it helps to expound fully the subject of Canonical Literature. In other words, Naya-vada even though it is used in revealing the Truth partially, supports the whole Truth which is Anekad harmatmaka Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

To sum up, all the Parisuddha Nayas by doing their duties independently, contribute collectively to unravel the whole Truth. Contrary to that, Aparisuddha Nayavada (Impure Nayavada) not only refuses the other Paksa but disproves what it has to prove. Because the statement which it has to make for a particolar point cannot be done without a reference to other Nayas. So wbile disregarding the other Nayas, it disregards itself. The "nature" of a thing is nothing but a harmonious blending of all the points that go to make the thing. So when the relative importance of all the aspects is not recognized, we fall short of arriving at a correct estimate of a thing. That is why it has been told before that Aparisuddha Nayavada not only uproots the other Nayas but uproots itself. Words are uttered according to the opinion of the speaker and therefore we should understand that there are so many types of words as there are opinions about a thing. Opinions mean Nayavadas. Nayavadas are as many as there are types of words. All the Nayavadas when they are mutually regardless of each other are Para-samayas ( non-Jaina doctrines ). Therefore there are as many Para-samayas as there are mutually contradictory Nayas. In other words we should understand that there are as many Philosophies as there are mutually contradictory thought-processes and they all are non-Jaina in character and essence.

The attitude of Sankhya Philosophy towards soul and that of Buddhist Philosophy is that of Nityatva-vada and Anityatva-vada respectively. Both these view points are Para-samayas because they disregard each other, being extremes. Jaina Philosophy, while attempting to synthesize both the view-points, declares that the Soul is Nitya (never-changing) on the strength of Dravyastika-naga (Noumenal) and on the ground of Paryayastika-naya (Phenomenal) it is ever-changing. Thus, the Tattvas such as Atman etc. are both changeless and changeful, And this is the real Jaina principle which represents a synthetical view. Here arises a question that if Jaina Philosophy means a harmonious combination of mutually contradictory views such as Nitytva and Anitytva, Vaisesika Darsana also will have to be styled a Jaina Darsana because it is also sympathetic to both the views. Reply to that question will have to be sought in the fact that it may be so in Vaisesika Darsanas but there is a radical difference between both the Darsanas in the form that VaisesikaDarsana does not recognize importance of "relativity." And this is what distinguishes Jaina Philosophy from Vaisesika Philosophy. The Nayas as used in Vaisesika Darsan view the subject independently becanse Vaisesika-Darsana believes that Paramanu, Atman etc, which are Nitya (eternal) will Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

So Nityatva (eternality) has no place in the transient things and transience in eternal things. In short, it has recognized both the eternal and transient things no doubt but it does not admit that one and the same thing can be Nitya and Anitya at one and the same time. This is the differentiating feature and that is why VaisesikaDarsana is not Jaina Darsana. Jaina Philosophy harmonizes antagonistic properties of a thing while Vaisesika Philosophy recognizes distinction between them. This is a radical difference between both the philosophies. In the same way, the explanation exists between general and particular. Vaisesika-Darsana acknowledges two independent elements namely general and particular designations of a thing. Jaina Darsana dogmatizes that a thing has a twofold nature (general and particular) and there cannot be two independent entities such as general and particular with reference to one and the same thing. 46-49.

________________ 170 ] SANMATI-TARKA [III. 50-52 pre-exists in the Cause. Contrary to that, Sankhyas being Abhedavadi, dogmatize that Cause and Effect are one and the same and therefore their cardinal principle is that Effect pre-exists in the Cause. Bauddhas and Vaisesikas - while establishing thier ground, point out by way of objection that if the Effect pre-exists in Cause, efforts to bring out a new product are meaningless, Effect as it preexists in the Cause, should appear in it before its real manifestation and lastly all the endeavour regarding Effect should also be done before its real origination takes place. Thus the Sadvada Paksa of Sankhyas is ridiculed. Just so the Sankhyas in their turn advance arguments in order to prove the Agatkarya-vada of Buddhas and Vaisesikas as untenable. Their chief difficulty in accepting it lies in the fact that if an Effect not previously existing in the Cause, is produced, any Cause should yield any Effect. There should be no reason why earth should produce pot and fabrics a cloth. And lastly if Asat Vastu comes into existence, why man should not have horns etc. There both the theories are true no doubt in accusing each other because they both stand on extremes--thus becoming prone to fallacious reasoning. But these two imperfect theories when they are harmoniously adjusted become perfect and there is no margin left for the faults and loop-boles. Thus the Cause and Effect are Bhinna and Abhinna both. Effect, being different, from cause is Asat (not pre-existing) before its real production and as it is Abhinna (identical) it is Sat (pre-existing in the latent form) also.

It is Asat from the view-point of "production" (Utpatti); from the view.point of "potentiality" it is always Sat. This explodes the rival theory that any cause can produce any effect as well as a man can have horps. A cause which has a latent power to produce a thing can do so when efforts are made to make it manifest. Thus the drawbacks which severally attach to every theory vanish when Anekanta view-point is applied to it. Any theory when it is not based upon Aneka ta-drsti can never ensure perfect knowledge, in spite of its strength and on account of this very defect it cannot disentangle a man who has been entrapped into it. While Samanyaya ("Synthesis") is based upon a broader aspect and is able enough to free a man from narrow-mindedness. According to Anekanta.drsti, Effect Ghata is Bhinna (separate) from as well as Abhinna (identical) with the cause Earth. It is identical with the earth because earth has got a potentiality to produce a Gbata and Ghata, when it is produced, is not without the essence of earth. It is Bhinna (separate or different) because before its production as a Ghata there was merely earth and the Ghata was not manifest.

(55) There is soul; It is eternal : It does ; It experiences ; It can be liberated and there is a remedy for liberation--all these six theories are abodes of right knowledge. Here in these verses we find a statement of those dogmas of the rival schools which come in our way of spiritual developement and a statement also of those which help us in accomplishing spiritual progress. Dogmas which interfere with the accomplishment of spiritual progress are based on a mistaken view while those which are instrumental in bringing about spiritual evolution are grounded on a right view-point. Those schools of dogmas are mentioned as under in dne order: (1) It is called Anatmavada which does not recognize any Tattva (reality) such as Atman (soul) : (2) Ksanikatmavada is that which acknowledges soul but its Atman is not eternal and hence destructible ; (3) A school, which accepts that there is soul and it is eternal Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org

If a prejudice is cultivated for anyone of the six theories, spiritual progress will at all be stopped or bampered seriously. And one who wishes to ensure spiritual development should pin his faith on all the below-mentioned rival theories :-(1) There is soul; (2) It is indestructible; (3) It is an agent- a doer ; (4) It is an experiencer also ; (5) In spite of its power as an agent and an experiencer, there is every possibility to put a stop to Raga and Dvesa which compel it to act ; (6) There is a way to effect their stoppage and it is practicable also. These six, theories are Samyak (true) because they inspire faith in tbe subject and push him forward in his progress. 54-55.

A Vadi entering into discussion never gets success if his discussions are not based on versatility of aspects. On the contrary, he becomes Asad vadi (liar), is defeated and falls a prey to the cultured. It does not matter whether a defendent proves his point by a positive or a negative example but he will no doubt come into conflict with the opposite party if his judgments are one-sided. To avoid these, he should never make use of a major term ( Sadhya ) with radical view in a syllogism. Only a Samanya (generality) is the subject of Nonmenal and Particularity of Phenomenal. When these two are engaged independently, they end into Radical viewpoint. If a defendent, while proving his point, employs the Sudhya (major term) with radical view-point, the opposite party defeats him seeing his weak point. It is, then, patent that bad that defendent jemployed his Sadhya with versatility of view-points-thus avoiding a loop hole, he would never suffered a defeat at the bands of his opponent. What to talk of a thing which is totally false on ac. count of radical view-point? If a statement which is true from one point of view is put forward by the defendent in bis discussion as an uncertain statement, he lowers himself down in the eyes of others who may be practical and proficient.

As for example, when Dhyana (meditation), Tyaga (charity) etc. are to be described, a strict attention to at least eight things mentioned above should be paid. 60: Faults in a Sutra which is taken as perfect: पाडेक्कनयपहगयं सुत्तं सुत्तहरसहसंतुट्रा। - अविकोवियसामत्था जहागमविभत्तपडिवत्ती॥ 61 ॥ . सम्मइंसणमिणमो सयलसमत्तवयणिजनिहोस ।

________________ SANMATI-TARKA 1801 [III 64, 65 No one can come to possess the real knowledge of Siddhanta by mere devotion of the Canon. And also its knower as a rule is not entitled to make an exposition of the Sastras. One believes that he has a right to interpret the Canon because he has a devotional fervour for it while the other believes that he has a right to do so because he has a knowledge of it. The author, with reference to both these types of people, says that he only has a claim who possesses a perfect and a definite knowledge of the Sastra. That cannot be accomplished by a meagre knowledge of the Sastras or by a mere devotional fervour because many do not have Sastric knowledge even though they have a reverence for it while those who have its knowledge do not hold necessary qualifications to do so. This fitness is rarely to be found even in those people who are well-versed in Sastras. 63 Statement as to what should be done for the attainment of perfect knowledge of the realities: सुत्तं अत्थनिमेणं न सुत्तमेत्तेण अत्थपडिवत्ती। game su vaarate CUT THEAT 11 9811 तम्हा अहिगयसुत्तेण अत्थसंपायणम्मि जइयव्वं ।

________________ III. 64, 65 ] CHAPTER III [ 181 (64) Sutra is a receptacle of meaning. But mere Sutra does not yield meaning. Knowledge of a genuine meaning is difficult to be obtained as it is dependent on a complex Nayavada theory. (65) Therefore, those who know the Sutra, should try to get at the right meaning because the presumptuous and ignorant preceptors misinterpret the Sastras. . The author retorts to one who, by the mere knowledge of the Sutras, boasts to have known the realities, and declares that the recital of the Sutra is no doubt an abode of meaning but mere recital cannot give rise to a perfect and right meaning. Such a knowledge, as it is dependent on a complex Nayavada theory is difficult to be obtained. If then Nayavada is thoroughly mastered it is easily obtained Therefore one who wishes to obtain a full and genuine knowledge of realities, should strive to get at the meaping having first learnt the Sutras which may not be contradictory and which may have been evolved with reference to Nayag. For this the theory of Nayas should be well studied. Those who do not do this, lower down. the Canon in the eyes of others because they are nothing more than presqmptuous and ignorant people. 64, 65.

(67) Those, who strictly adhere to rules and regulations and who have left of thinking Jaina and non-Jaina doctrines, are people who do not know the fruit of such rules and regulations with Niscaya.Drsti (from philosophical point of view). With reference to those who are fond of degrees and diplomas as well as who have stuck fast to the mud in the form of attachment for papils and paraphernalia and also with reference to those that are mad after ceremonious performances.

________________ 111. 68] CHAPTER III [ 183 Stamp of erudition and a large crowd of pupils do not prove Sastric knowledge. On the contrary, pomp and hypocrisy come in the way of acquisition of right knowledge. Those who leave aside meditating and thinking and indulge in simply observing rules and regulations are not entitled to reap their fruits. The fruit of philosophical thinking is to acquire right knowledge of realities and to purify the soul through cultivating a right taste for it. If thinking on Sastric things is left off, ordinary knowledge of roalities will not arise. And when there is no possibility of even ordinary knowledge, what to talk of puru, unsullied knowledge ? Without such knowledge right perception will be impossible and without right perception purity of soal can never be attained. So for one whose aim and end is purity of soul, observance of religious practices is not the only necessary thing but philosophical thinking also. :3 For one who is not able to start independent thinking on Sastric things, the royal road to be entitled to the fruit of religious practices is to resort to a true preceptor and to pass his life there and breathe healthy atmosphere of philosophical thinking which surrounds his teacher. 66. 67.

________________ 184 ) SANMATI-TARKA (III. 69 Knowledge without religious practices and religious practices without knowledge are not able to free a man from the turmoils of birth and death because they both are Ekantas (extreme view-points). In the preceding verse, the importance of knowledge with the religious practices is referred to while here the verse contains a suggestion to make use of Anekanta-disti in order to establish a synthesis. : No good result can be arrived at without allround spiritulal progress. Its powers are mainly two. One is Cetana ( vitality ) and the other is Virya ( Action-power ). These two powers are so interlocked that the development of one gives rise to that of the other. Thus simultaneous development of both the powerg is indispensable. Development of vitality means acquisition of knowledge and that of Virya (action-power) means the shaping of the life according to knowledge. Without knowledge, proper moulding of life is not possible and without properly shaping the life, the life itself is meaningless. This is why it is said that knowledge and practice are severally the two extremes. If these two extremes are understood in right perspective, they yield fruit. In this connection the proverb of "The Blind and the Lame" is famous. 68 Conclusion : भई मिच्छा सगसमूहमझ्यस्त असनसारस्स। जिरणवयणस्म भगवो साविमासुहाहिम्मस्व  ॥ 68  ॥ Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
________________ III. 69 ] CHAPTER III ( 185 Be good to Jainism which is the reposi. tory of all heresies and which is nectar of nectars and which is easily understood by those desirous of liberation. Three adjectives are used by the author here while wishing good luck to Jainism, By the adjective "Repository of all heresies" the author means to say that the peculiarity of Jaina Philosophy consists in accomplisbing its utility by properly accomodating various types of thought-processes which are false as they wend their way in complete disrespect towards each other. By the second adjective "Easily understood by those who are desirous of liberation" the author intends to say that Jainism can be easily understood by those who approach it with unbiassed mind or by those who are desirous of liberation even though it is very very complex on account of the fact that it tries to synthesize all the mutually conflicting theories and thought-processes. The right to understand it consists in cessation of distress. By the third adjective "Nectar of nectars" the author means that Jainism has a latent power to bring immortality to one who wants to thoroughly utilize it, through destroying distresses by the words of the Jinas which are understood only by those who are unprejudiced and the central argument of which is based on complete "impartiality" (Madhyasthya). On account of these three things it deserves worship and adoration, 69 END :0: Jain Education International For Private & Personal Use Only www.jainelibrary.org
