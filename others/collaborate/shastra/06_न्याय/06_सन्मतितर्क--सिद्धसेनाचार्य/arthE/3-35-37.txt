Time-limit of Utpada (origination) etc. is different from one another and also is not. So also they should be considered different and non-different from Dravya.
Time of extension is not the time of drawing in. And also, there is no interval between destruction and origination of extension and drawing in.
A particular Dravya is produced, is being produced and shall be produced; so also a particular Dravya is destroyed, is being destroyed and shall be dstroyed :-these two sets of speaking show nothing but particularizing that substance from three viewpoints of Time.
