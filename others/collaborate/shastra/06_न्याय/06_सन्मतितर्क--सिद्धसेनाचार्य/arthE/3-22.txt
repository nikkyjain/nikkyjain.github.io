"We ask," says the person holding the view of absolute identity "the persons who regard substance and quality as different from each other this :-Is it possible for a substance to have various transformations ? For, we hold that a substance is one and unchangeable." To this the author replies by saying that the final opinion in this matter has been given by men of authority in Jaina Sastra and it is this that a substance undergoes and does not undergo various transformations owing to some exterior causes. Nothing absolutely or dogmatically can be said in this matter.
