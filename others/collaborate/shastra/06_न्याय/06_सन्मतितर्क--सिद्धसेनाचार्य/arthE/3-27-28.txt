s the doctrine of Anekanta shows all possible sides of a thing and thus does not postulate about a thing in any fixed way, in the same way Anekanta itself is also subject to this possibility of other side that is to say, it also sometimes assumes the form of onesidedness (Ekanta). The author admits that thus Anekanta may also become Ekanta if it does not go against the right view of things.
For instance, a man who pins his faith on the six Kayas does not really show the right sort of faith. Because thereby a sense of unity is imposed on disunity.
