 Dravyastika Naya in its pure form is only concerned with the simple statement 'It is' that is to say when the thing is inentioned divested of all its particular attributes or modifications. All other statements deal, in one way or the other, with some attribute or the other and as such is the subject of both the Dravyastika and Paryayastika.
