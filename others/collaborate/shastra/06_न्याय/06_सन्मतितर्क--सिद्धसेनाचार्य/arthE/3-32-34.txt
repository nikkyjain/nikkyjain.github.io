Creation is of two kinds one natural and another brought about by special efforts (artificial). Artificial creation is known by the names of Samudaya-vada and ApariSuddha.
Natural creation is also of two kinds:-Samudaya-krta . and Aikatvika. Aikatvika creation (or rather onesided creation) is seen in Akasa, Dharma and Adharma. It is due to external causes and is not seen invariably.
The same is the case with destruction. It is of two kinds natural and artificial. It is also found in Samudayakrta creation in two ways. One is in the form of separation of aggregates and another is a destruction which is in the form of assuming quite a new form.
