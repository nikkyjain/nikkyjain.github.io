As it is impossible to separate milk from water when they both are intermingled with each other, similarly it is neither possible nor logical to separate two things (such as the soul and the matter in the present case) when they are inextricably blended together or when one permeates the other. No one can point out in such cases, that this is one thing and this another. It is not possible to distribute the Paryayas of a composite thing into its component parts.
All the modifications in a body such as form and others should be described as inextricably mixed together. Similarly in the case of the soul all the attributes of it in the state of its temporal existence should be described as interpenetrating.
