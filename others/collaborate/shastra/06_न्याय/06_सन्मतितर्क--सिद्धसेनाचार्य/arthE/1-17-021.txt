This worldly life cannot be accounted for from Dravyastika standpoint. It is equally unaccountable from Paryayastika point of view. For, the former holds that there is only one element and stable thing; while the latter holds that birth and decay are the true characteristics of a thing.
From the point of view of those who hold that an entity is unchangeable, happiness and misery cannot stand ; in the opinion of those who hold that things eternally change the idea of happiness and misery can never hold good. 
'Action-current (yoga) attaches or binds a man through mind, speech and body. And it is through our passions (Kasayas) that this action-current binding a man takes its firm stand. But if we think that a thing is eternally unchangeable or when we think that thing is born and in a moment decays, we can never account for the binding of an action-current or its continuance. 
If there is no binding by Actioncurrent, then it will be a folly to think that this worldly life is beset with perils. If, on the other hand, there be no Bandha i.e. binding then it is idle to desire the happiness of liberation in fact then there cannot be any such thing as liberation at all. 
All the Nayas, therefore, in their exclusively individual standpoints are absolutely faulty. If, however, they consider themselves as supplementary of each other, they are right in their viewpoints.
