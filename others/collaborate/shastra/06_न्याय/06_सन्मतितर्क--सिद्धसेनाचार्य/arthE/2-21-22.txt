Just as all Avagraha is Darsana and definite comprehension of a thing such as 'This is a jar' is knowledge, in the same manner, definite and indefinite apprehension is the differentiating factor between Absolute knowledge and Absolute perception.
Perception necessarily precedes knowledge but knowledge never precedes perception. It can, therefore, be definitely: asserted that, in a Kevalin, knowledge and perception are not different from each other.
