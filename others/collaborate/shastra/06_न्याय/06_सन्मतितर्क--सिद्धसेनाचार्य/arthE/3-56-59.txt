When Ekantavadi (Radicalist) establishes a conclusion by Sadharmya (Similari. ty; analogy) or Vaidharmya (dissimilarity), they both result in an Asadvada. 
Noumenal view-point is concerned with Samanya (general) and Phenomenal view-point with Visesa (particular). When they are employed independently, they give rise to Radical view-point.
The opponent disproves the Sadhya (major term) which is going to be proved by Hetu (Middle term) because it has been put in an objectionable way. Who would have conquered the Vadi who has employed the major term as it ought to be employed ?
Vadi who speaks utter falsehood or who makes an indefinite statement even though it may be true, is accused by the examiners.
