When the obstruction in the way of absolute knowledge is completely removed, absolute knowledge springs up as a matter of course. Similarly when the obstruction in the path of absolute perception is completely removed, absolute perception springs forth as a matter of course.
It is said that as sensuous knowledge is not possible in the case of a man with absolute knowledge when the obstructions in his path are completely removed, in the same manner perception at a time different from that of knowledge is not possible in a man, all the obstructions in whose path are absolutely removed.
The Sutra expressly says that absolute knowledge or perception has beginning but no end. Those who have any regard for the commandment (i.e. import) of the Sutra must pause and ponder over the Sutra.
If we persist in saying that at the time of absolute perception, knowledge is not possible, and that, at the time of absolute knowledge, perception is not possible, it would mean that both have end, but this is absurd, since we already know from the Satra that both are endless).
