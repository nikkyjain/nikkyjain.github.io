Agama (canon or canonical Literature) which propounds Religion, consists of Hetuvada (Rational portion) and Ahetuvada (dogmatic portion). Padarthas (categories) such as Bhavya and Abhavya etc. are the proper subjects for Ahetavada.
Bhavya according to Hetuvada removes or destroys all unhappiness through Right vision, Right knowledge and Right conduct.
He only is Aradhaka (propagator of right religion) who takes recourse to Hetu only when Hetuvada is to be discussed and relies on Agama when Agamavada is under discussion. One, who does not do this, is Viradhaka (heretic).
