Soul is Anadi-nidhana and perfect knowledge has a beginning and no end. Thus there being a gulf of difference, how can soul become Kevala-rupa.
Therefore, some believe that soul is different due to the differences in characteristics such as Aupasamika etc. and its modificatory changes such as Jnana etc. are also different.
This has been referred to before while controverting Ekanta-paksa. Still, however, I am inclined to cite an example which points to the relationship between Sadhya and Hetu (Major Term and Middle Term).
Just as the word 'became' in 'A sixty years old man became a king at the age of thirty show's a difference in years."
So also Jiva-dravya without any Visesa is Anadinidhana. Thus a Kevala paryaya just as Raja (in the above example) is a visesa and nothing more.
We cannot make this one-sided statement that the eternal soul is soul and nothing else, that is to say, it is in a general form and none else. Because a soul embodied in a man's frame is treated as different from a soul embodied in a god's frame.
