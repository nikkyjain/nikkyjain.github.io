Let alone the difference between substance and quality. First we have to consider whether the words Guna and Paryaya are used in different senses or are used as synonyms ?
Lord Mahavira has once for all acknowledged only two points of views namely Dravyastika and Paryayastika; now if the idea of Guna would have been altogether different from the idea of Paryaya, He would have certainly admitted a third viewpoint namely that of Gunastika. 
But in as much as Lord Mahavira, in various sutras addressed to Gautama and others, has fixed the comotation of Paryaya and has explained that word, it must be said that the real thing is Paryaya that is to say Gunas are not different from Paryayas.
Paryayas are those that subject a thing to various transformations and Gunas are those that make a thing assume various forms. Both these words are synonyms but the words are not interchangeable for the word Paryaya is propagated by Lord Mahavira, but He has not used the word Gunastika.
Some say that in Agamas the transformation of colour is mentioned as onefold (Eka-guna) black, tenfold black, infinitefold black. It is therefore clear that there is a difference between Guna and Paryaya.
To this the author replies :-The word Guna when applied with reference to colour as well as the degree of colour is used to show the number of peculiar transformations. It does not signify, Gunastika. Here the word Guna is purely numerical and nothing else.
As tenness is common in ten things or tenfold one thing. In the same manner we should understand in the case of one fold, twofold black etc.
