According to the view of absolute difference between substance and quality a substance is that which has a permanent state and a quality is that which is produced and which perishes. But the author objects to these definitions of substance and quality and says that the definitions would have been proper if substance would have been altogether different from quality and if quality would have been absolutely different from substance. But they cannot be applied to a substance and quality in one.
If qualities are regarded as absolutely different from a substance they are either corporeal (Murta) or incorporeal (Amurta). If they are corporeal then Paramanu (an atom) which is a substance and in which qualities are said to reside will also be corporeal for it is a repository of corporeal things. But the universally accepted characteristics of an atom is that it is incorporeal; while on the other hand qualities are regarded as incorporeal then they will never be known.
