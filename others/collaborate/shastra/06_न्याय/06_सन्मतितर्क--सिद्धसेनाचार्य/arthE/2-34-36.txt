Some do not recognize Visesa which means a modificatory change because they have become reckless on account of the sutra which is to the effect that perfect knowledge is without an end but not without a beginning.
Those particular conditions such as bodily frame etc. which exist in a perfect being -- Kevali who is still not a Siddha do not remain as entities when he attains Siddhatva. It means, then, Kevala is destroyed.
Moreover, this Artha-paryaya, which is just like absolute knowledge, comes into being in the form of Siddhatva. With reference to Kevala-Bhava the sutra declares that it is without an end.
