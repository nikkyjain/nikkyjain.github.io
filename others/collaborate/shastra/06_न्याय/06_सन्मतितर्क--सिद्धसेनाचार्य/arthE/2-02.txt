At the time of perception i.e. from the Dravyastika point of view the soul appears in its general aspect. But even then (i.e. at the time of perception) it is with its particular attributes also when its quality of Upasama is concerned. Exactly otherwise does the soul appear when viewed from Paryayastika point of view; but even then, though it seems to appear with its particular aspects only, it maintains at the same time its general character also.
