This rule of separate time for the two cognitions, perception and knowledge, holds good upto the knowledge called Manahparyaya (thought-reading of others). But in the case of the highest kind of knowledge called Kevala Jnana (the supreme or the absolute knowledge) no such separate time for perception and knowledge is necessary; for these two cognitions syncronize in Kevala Jnana (absolute knowledge). In fact at this stage, perception and knowledge are one and the same.
