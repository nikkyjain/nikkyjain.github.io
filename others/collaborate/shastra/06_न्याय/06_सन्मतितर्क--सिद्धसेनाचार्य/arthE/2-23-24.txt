If you say that all Avagraha is Darsana and comprehending the particulars of a thing is Gyana (knowledge) then it follows that Mati-Gyana alone is Darsana (perception).
The same must be said of all the rest of the senses as regards Darsana. But this is absurd. Now if in the case of objects of other senses, only knowledge is accepted the same must be accepted in the case of the objects of sight.
