Sutra is a receptacle of meaning. But mere Sutra does not yield meaning. Knowledge of a genuine meaning is difficult to be obtained as it is dependent on a complex Nayavada theory.
Therefore, those who know the Sutra, should try to get at the right meaning because the presumptuous and ignorant preceptors misinterpret the Sastras.
