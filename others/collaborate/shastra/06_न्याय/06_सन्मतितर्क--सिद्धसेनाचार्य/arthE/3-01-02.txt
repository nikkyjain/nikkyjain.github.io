Sometimes the particular is mentioned with reference to the general, while sometimes the general is mentioned with reference to the particular. Such mixed references go to prove that apart from the general there is such a thing as its particular that is different from it or from its transformation, however, that particular is in no way different from the general.
A person who refers exclusively to the general divests it of its particulars; similarly a person who talks of the particulars exclusively divorces them from their general.
