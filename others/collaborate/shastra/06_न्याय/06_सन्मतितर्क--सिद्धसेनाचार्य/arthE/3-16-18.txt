We have already refuted the opinion that there is absolute difference between a substance and its quality. Here we want to give an illustration which will corroborate the identity of a substance and its quality. 
We have to regard that a father, a son, a grandson, a nephew or a brother has different relation with one and the same person. For, a person who is a father to one cannot be a father to all.
Just as a man though of the same form appears to be different from the standpoint of different persons, in the same manner the same substance when perceived by different persons appears to assume different aspects such as colour etc. That is to say it is mentioned as various particular things or attributes.
