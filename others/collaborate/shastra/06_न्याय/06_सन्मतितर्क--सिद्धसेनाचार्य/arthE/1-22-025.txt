Just as emerald and other jewels of rare quality and of excellent kind do not acquire the designation of a necklace of jewels even though all of them be priceless jewels on account of their lying unconnected with or disunited with each other, similarly every Naya in its own sphere is right, but if all of them arrogate to themselves the whole truth and disregard the views of rival Naya then they do not attain the status of a right view.
Moreover, just as those jewels unite with each other and occupy the place that is assigned to them individually in the string, they, all together, attain the designation of a necklace of jewels, disowning their individual names.
Similarly if all the Nayas arrange themselves in a proper way and supplement to each other, then alone they are worthy of being termed as the whole truth SamyagDarsana or the right view in its entirety. But in this case they merge their individuality in the collective whole.
