If we desire to describe a thing simultaneously from the standpoint of its own particularising elements and the particularising elements of another thing, it baffles description and is said to be indescribable.
If we desire to say that a thing partly exists from one point of view (or in a cartain sense) and does not exist from another point of view -- that thing is said to exist and not to exist. (38) If we desire to say that one part of a thing exists and another exists and does not exist at the same time the thing is said to be existing and indescribable.
If we desire to say that one part of a certain thing does not exist and another part does and does not exist at the same time, the thing is said to be not existing and indescribable.
If one part of a thing does and does not exist and another does and does not exist at the same time -- the thing is said to be existing, not existing and indescribable."
