The only subject of pure Naya-vada (a system of view-points) is the exposition of the Canon. If it is not rightly applied, it spoils both purposes. 
Naya-vada are as many in number as there are methods of putting the sentences. Para-samayas (heresies) also are so many as Naya-vadas.
Philosophy taught and promulgated by Kapila is nothing but a representation of Dravyastika-naya (Noumenal) and that which is taught by Buddha--the son of Suddhodana is an exposition of Paryayastika Naya (phenomenal) pure and simple.
Although the philosophical exposition is made by Kanada (who is also known by the name of Uluka) with reference to both the Nayas but it is full of fallacies because both the Nayas are made use of independently.
