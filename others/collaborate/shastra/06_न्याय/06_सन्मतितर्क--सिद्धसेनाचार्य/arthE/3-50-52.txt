Faults and Fallacies which are there according to Bauddhas and Vaisesikas in the Sadwada (theory of evolution) of Sankhya are all true and those of Asadvada Paksa. (theory of creation) of which the Bauddhas and Vaisesikas are accused hold also true.
When this Sadvada and Asadvada are adjusted according to Anekanta the result is Samyag-Darsana (Right vision), because they both are not severally able to liberate a man from the world.
The same reason, which proves the Jar not a separate entity from the earth, accounts for the fact that it is same as earth. And because the earth was not a pot before, it is also separate from it.
