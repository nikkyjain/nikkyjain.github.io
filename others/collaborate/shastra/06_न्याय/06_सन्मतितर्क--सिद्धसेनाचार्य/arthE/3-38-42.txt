Coming into existence of a new Dravya (substance) is described, by some, as a conjunction of one Dravya with the other. Disjunction cannot beget a new Dravya. These people are, it should be said, do not know the real nature of Utpatti (origination) because,-
It is customary to say "This is Anu" with respect to a Dravya consisting of two Paramanus (Dvyanuka) and also 'This is Tryanuka' in the case of a Dravya which is composed of many Dvyanukas. Moreover, when an Anu disunites from a Tryanuka, we say 'Anu is produced.' 
If you believe that only conjunction is responsible for the origination of a new Dravya on the ground that word Eka (one) is used in the place of Bahu (many), then it is easy to show that by the division of one (Eka) many are produced.
In one Samaya (indivisible unit of time), one Dravya produces some times, many Utpadas, Sthitis and Vinasas.
Origination of a Dravya is the result of modifications of Sarira (body), Manas (mind), Vacana (speech), Kriya (action), Rupa (form), Gati (motion), Samyoga (conjunction), Bhedana (disjunction) and Gyana (knowledge).
