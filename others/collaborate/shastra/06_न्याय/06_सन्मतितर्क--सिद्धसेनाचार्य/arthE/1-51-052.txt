According to the standpoint of Dravyastikanaya the soul does exist and therefore it is bound by Karma and gets the fruit of this bondage of Karma. According to Paryayastika on the other hand, there is nothing except creation. Neither, therefore, is anything bound or gets fruit of the bondage. 
According to the view of Dravyastika whosoever does any thing, necessarily gets the fruit of it himself. According to the view of Paryayastika, however, some one does an act and another receives the fruit of that act.
