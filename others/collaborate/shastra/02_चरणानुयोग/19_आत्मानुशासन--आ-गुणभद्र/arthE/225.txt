The one who is engaged in observance of vows (‘yama’ and ‘niyama’)*, whose introverted-soul is rid of sensepleasures, who remains steady in meditation, who is compassionate in respect of all living beings, who accepts only helpful and limited food as per the procedure laiddown in the Scripture, is without sleep, and has acquired knowledge of the secrets of spiritual-advancement; such a man extirpates all anxieties.
