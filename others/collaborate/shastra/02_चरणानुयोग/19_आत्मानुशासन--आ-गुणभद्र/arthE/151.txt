O knower of the essence of the Scripture! Caves are your residences; the directions and the sky clothe you; advancement in austerity is your pleasing food; and qualities like right faith (samyagdar≈õana), rather than women, are your charms. Thus, you have nothing to plead for. Do not unnecessarily become miserable by pleading for favours.
