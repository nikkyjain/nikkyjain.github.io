The (so called) ‘wise’ men desire perfection hereafter, but without appreciating that renouncing attachment-topossessions (parigraha) is the cause (hetu) and tranquility of the mind, the effect (hetuphala), they harp just on tranquility of their mind. Their conduct has inherent contradiction, like that apparent in the cat and the mouse. This is the effect of the kali age (the fifth period, called duÈamā). Fie on such ‘wise’ men; they greatly deceive themselves as they get deprived of enjoyment in this world as well as the next.
