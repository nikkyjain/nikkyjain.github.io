O worthy soul! As fruits of your actions, based on  wrongknowledge, attachment and aversion, etc., you have acquired, over and over again, births and deaths in this world. Rest assured that by opposite actions, based on right-knowledge and  indifference to worldly pursuits, you will certainly obtain the opposite fruit, i.e., the state of everlasting bliss.
