The dirt sticking to their bodies is their ornament; the surface of the rock is their resting place; the gravelled earth is their bedstead; the natural, insulated abode of the panthers is their dwelling; they are rid of volition concerning ‘me’ and ‘mine’; their knot of darkness of ignorance has opened; and they long for nothing but liberation. May such possessors of the riches of knowledge purify our hearts!
