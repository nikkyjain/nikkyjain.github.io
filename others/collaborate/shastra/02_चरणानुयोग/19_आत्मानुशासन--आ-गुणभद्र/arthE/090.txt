O unwise soul! The harm that karmas did to you in the childhood is not fit even to be remembered. There is no misery that karmas did not make you suffer in the middle-age when, in pursuit of wealth, you undertook difficult tasks. In the old-age, karmas have punished you, disparagingly and mercilessly, with acts like uprooting your teeth. See, in spite of such unfavourable acts, you still wish to live under control of karmas.
