O worthy soul! That beautiful and high-born woman, called ‘mukti’ or ‘liberation’, can only be had by noble men. She is the love of the whole world and a lover of virtues. Adorn her with the ornament of the Three Jewels (ratnatraya), if you desire to have her. Do not even talk of any other (worldly) woman. Have excessive love solely for her, since women, in general, are jealous.
