(As per the Hindu mythology–) The super-deva (Mahādeva, the destroyer), subjugated by anger and not appreciating that Cupid lived in his own heart, had burnt down certain external thing mistaking it for the ‘god of love’. Cupid, later on, made him suffer greatly. It is right; whose effort does not become worthless by anger?
