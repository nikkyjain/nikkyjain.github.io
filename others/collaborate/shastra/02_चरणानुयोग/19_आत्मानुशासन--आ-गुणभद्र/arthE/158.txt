In order to keep his body stable, the ascetic, rich in austerities (tapa), thinks of accepting a little food, offered with devotion by others, at a particular time and as per the method prescribed in the Scripture. This too causes great embarrassment to this great-soul (mahātmā). It is then a wonder if such a great-soul accepts other demonlike possessions.
