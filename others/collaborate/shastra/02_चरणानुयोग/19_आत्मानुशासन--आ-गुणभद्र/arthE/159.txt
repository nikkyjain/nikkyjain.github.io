The giver of the gift is the householder and the wealth that he offers with devotion to the worthy recipient is the food. The ascetic, who has the well-being of all in mind and who is unconcerned about own body, accepts this wealth of food. Even this desire for food causes embarrassment to the self-respecting ascetics. How, then, the givers (the householders) and the recipients (the ascetics) fall prey to attachment and aversion in respect of giving and taking of food? Surely, this is the ill-effect of the kali age (the fifth period, called duÈamā).
