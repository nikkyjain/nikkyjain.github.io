These [wrong faith (mithyādarśana), etc.] are demerits and, as a rule, these [rise of perception-deluding (darśanamohanīya), etc.] are its causes. These [right faith (samyagdarśana), etc.] are merits and, again, these [subsidence, destruction and subsidence-cum-destruction of perception-deluding (darśanamohanīya), etc.] are its causes. Having thus ascertained the causes, the man who abandons those that are harmful and accepts those that are beneficial is wise. He only is equipped with right conduct (samyakcāritra); he only is the storehouse of happiness and renown.
