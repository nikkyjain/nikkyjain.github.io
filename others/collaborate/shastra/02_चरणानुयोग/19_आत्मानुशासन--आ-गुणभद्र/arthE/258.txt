The supreme ascetics, able to endure various afflictions, who have vowed to become independent by renouncing all external and internal possessions; who are rid of misgivings; who feel embarrassed having earlier erroneously considered their unhelpful body as helpful; who are engaged in attainment of their goal (of liberation) – such valiant supreme ascetics, like lion among men, rid of delusion, sitting in seclusion in a posture called ‘palyańkāsana’ on a mountain, in a dreadful forest, or in a cave, meditate on the way to get rid of the body, on the nature of the pure-soul, or on the Three Jewels (ratnatraya).
