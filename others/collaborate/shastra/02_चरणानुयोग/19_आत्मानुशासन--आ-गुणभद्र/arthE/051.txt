The man devoid of fear and compassion, pointlessly
wishes to kill all, and desires endlessly in this life
enjoyment of pleasures which are frightful, like the 
serpent. Also, the overtly sensuous man cannot get the
divine pleasures in his next-life (in heaven, etc.). Fie on
the wretch who desires for that which is censured by the
saints! It is right; which despicable activity is not possible
by the man whose mind is besieged by the great demons
of lust and anger? He engages mindlessly in all sorts of
deplorable activities.
