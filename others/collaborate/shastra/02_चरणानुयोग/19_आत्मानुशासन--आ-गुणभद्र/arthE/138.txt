In this world, sovereignty with just rule and austerity (tapa) with scriptural knowledge, both are venerated. Between these two, if one leaves sovereignty and accepts austerity, he becomes great. On the contrary, if one leaves austerity and accepts sovereignty, he becomes very low. This establishes that austerity is much more adorable than sovereignty. Thinking like this, the sin-fearing man must adopt wholesome and absolute austerity that removes the fear of worldly existence.
