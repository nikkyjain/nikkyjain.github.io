Women, like lakes, are only outwardly pretty to look at. As lakes look pretty with waves of clear water and lotuses, women, too, have lovely talk and laughter (like the waves of clear water), and charming faces (like the lotuses). As many foolish men, inflicted by thirst, enter the lakes from their banks and get swallowed by cruel water-animals, similarly, many ignorant men, inflicted by sensual-desire, go near the women and get killed by excessive lust. They are pushed into deplorable states of existence, like the infernal state of existence. It is extremely difficult to yet again get birth as a human being.
