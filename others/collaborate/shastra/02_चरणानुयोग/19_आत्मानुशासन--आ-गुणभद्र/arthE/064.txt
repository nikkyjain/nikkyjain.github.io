O worthy being! As the meek slave of your senses, like the eye, or the mind that rules over your senses, why do you chase anxiously the sense-pleasures, like the beautyobjects, and get involved in lowly conduct which only adds to your sins? Take control of your senses and, getting rid of anxiousness, ignore totally those sensepleasures. Make your soul happy by mastering the senses. Adopt such right conduct and you will wash off your sins. On being liberated, you will enjoy excellent bliss.
