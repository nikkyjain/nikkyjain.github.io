O worthy soul! Has not the terrible assembly of evilkarmas, like a colony of the bees, stung and wounded the
vitals of the man? Has his body not been set ablaze, for a
long time, by the flames of the fire of suffering? Has he
not heard the dreadful sound of the thundering bugles of
death? Then why does he not give up the delusiongenerated slumber that is sure to give rise to grief?
