Worthy saints who have vanquished delusion (moha) and are disciples of ancient-preceptors (pūrvācārya) exist even today. They tend the people, like the mountain-chains (kulācala parvata – Himavān and Mahāhimavān, etc.) protect the earth. Owning gems, like right faith (samyagdarśana), but with no desire for wealth, they are like the oceans which are repositories of precious jewels.Untouched (by attachment), they provide solace to all, like the expanse of space (ākāśa) which, though untouched, provides room to all
