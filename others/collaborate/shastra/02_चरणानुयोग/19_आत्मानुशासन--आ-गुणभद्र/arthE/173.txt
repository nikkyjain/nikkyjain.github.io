Any substance – soul or non-soul – exhibits neither absolute permanence (nityatva) nor absolute transience (anityatva). Also, the substance exhibits neither absolute cognition (jñāna, bodha) nor absolute non-existence (abhāva); no substance is actually seen as such. The substance is actually seen with its ever-changing attributes of affirmation (tat, vidhi – existence) as well as of negation (atat, niÈedha – non-existence) or of permanence (nityatva) as well as of transience (anityatva). It is without a beginning and an end. Just as a single substance is permanent (nitya) as well as transient (anitya), one (eka) as well as many (aneka), and distinctive (bheda) as well as non-distinctive (abheda), all substances exhibit these attributes.
