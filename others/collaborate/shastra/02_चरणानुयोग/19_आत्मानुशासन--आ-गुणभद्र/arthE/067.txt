The itinerary of the ascetics is at their free will; their partaking of food is without pleading; they live in the company of virtuous people; due to the effort of studying the Scripture, their faults like attachment (rāga) subside; and their tranquil mind, engrossed in the contemplation of the Self, reflects hardly on externalities. Even after deep deliberation for a long time, I just do not know what great austerities have endowed them with such attributes!
