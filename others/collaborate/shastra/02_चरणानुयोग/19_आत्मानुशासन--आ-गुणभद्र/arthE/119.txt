In whose service Indra had presented himself, six months before conception, as a  servant with folded hands; who himself was the creator of the world-order having taught the distressed subjects the ways of earning livelihood at the onset of the era of labour; whose son Bharata was the master of divine treasures (cakravartī, king-of-kings); even such a great personage – Ādinātha Tīrthańkara – had to wander on earth without getting food for six months. This is amazing. It is right that no one in this world is able to transgress the ways of the evil own-fate (daiva).
