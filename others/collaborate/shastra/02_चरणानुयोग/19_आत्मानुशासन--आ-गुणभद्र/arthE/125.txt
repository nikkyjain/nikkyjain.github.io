Where knowledge is the guide, modesty is the companion, austerity or control of desires is the provision, conduct is the palanquin, heavens are the resting places, virtues like freedom from attachment are the guards, the path (of the Three Jewels, ratnatraya) is straight (free from deceitfulness) with abundance of water of tranquility, and compassion is the shade; such a journey, removing all obstructions and hindrances on the way, reaches the ascetic to his desired destination (of liberation).
