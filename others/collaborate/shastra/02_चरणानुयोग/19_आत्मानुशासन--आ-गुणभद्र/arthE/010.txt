Having belief in the true nature of substances is right faith (samyagdarśana). It is of two kinds depending on whether it is attained by intuition (nisargaja) or by acquisition of knowledge (adhigamaja). It is of three kinds depending on the disposition or thought-activity (bhāva). That disposition (bhāva) which has subsidence as its object or cause, is subsidential (aupaśamika). Similarly with regard to destructional (kÈāyika) and destruction-cum-subsidential (kÈāyopaśamika). It is also of ten kinds, like revelation (ājñā) by Lord Jina, as will be detailed in the next four verses. Rid of the twenty-five imperfections like the three kinds of follies, and enriched further by qualities like perpetual fear of the cycle of existence – saÉvega, such right faith is the cause of the cessation of transmigration (saÉsāra); it purifies the knowledge by filtering out the three contaminators called wrong-sensory-knowledge (kumati), wrong-scripturalknowledge (kuśruta) and wrong-clairvoyance (vibhańga). It ascertains the seven substances of reality – tattva, like the soul and the non-soul, or the nature of the nine substances (padārtha) which comprise merit (pāpa) and demerit (puõya) besides the seven substances. For the intelligent disciple wishing to climb to the top of the edifice called liberation (mokÈa), this right faith (samyagdarśana) is the first rung of the ladder. As such, right belief is the first of the four adorations (arādhanā)
