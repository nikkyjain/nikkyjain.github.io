It is a great pity that the wicked Rāhu, of unknown abode, trunkless* and black with sin, verily swallows the glowing and powerful sun that embraces the earth with its thousand dazzling arms (rays). Indeed, no one is more powerful than karmas when these get to fruition. With completion of the age-karma (āyuÍ), no one can escape death.
