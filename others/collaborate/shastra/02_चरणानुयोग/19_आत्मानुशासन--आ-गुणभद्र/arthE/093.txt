The goose does not consume (eat, enjoy) the lotus. Being too unrelenting, the lotus does not befriend the water and it blooms only during the day and closes during the night. The bee does not see all this and, enamoured by its scent, gets entrapped and dies. It is right; the sensualist has no concern for own good!
