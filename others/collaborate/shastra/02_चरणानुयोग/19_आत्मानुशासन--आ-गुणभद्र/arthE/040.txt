Even the ‘king-of-kings’ (cakravartī) who attains, after a long time and great effort, lordship over the entire world has to renounce all his grandeur to attain the eternal bliss of liberation. Why not you renounce beforehand the worldly sense-objects? You would thus save yourself from ridicule, as the wanderer saint who had picked up, with the intention of washing it and not to eat, the piece of sweet-food which had fallen in filth.
