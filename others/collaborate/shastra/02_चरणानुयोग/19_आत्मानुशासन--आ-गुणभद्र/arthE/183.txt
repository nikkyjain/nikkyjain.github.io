Delusion (moha) is like a wound, similarly painful. Just as the old, demon-inflicted, deep, fluid-oozing, and painful wound is cleaned and healed by the ointment of clarified butter (ghee), etc., in the same way, the wound of delusion, which too is old (associated with the soul since beginningless time), inflicted by the demon of attachment-to-possessions, deep (serious), cause of adverse states of existence, and a source of anguish, is cleaned and healed by the ointment of renunciation. Upon its healing, the soul moves to the summit of the universe.
