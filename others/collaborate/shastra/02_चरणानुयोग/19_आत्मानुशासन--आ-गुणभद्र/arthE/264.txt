The perfect and pristine knowledge – omniscience (kevalajñāna) – enters its dwelling, the body of the ascetic. Like the fire burns up the wood completely but still keeps on burning without smoke (the charcoal fire), the fire of omniscience mercilessly burns up completely the body of the ascetic but still keeps on emitting sparkling light. It is right; the conduct of the ascetics is a land of wonders, all-around.
