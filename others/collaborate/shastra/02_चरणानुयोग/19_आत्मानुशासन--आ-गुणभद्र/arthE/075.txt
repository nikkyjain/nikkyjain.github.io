The creator-minister (Brahmā or karmas) has put the human-region in the middle, the evil-minded ‘asura’ (bhavanavāsī and vyantara devas) and the infernal beings below it, and the celestial beings (vaimānika devas) above it. Transversely, he placed the human-region in the centre of innumerable continents and oceans. Further, he secured the entire universe-space with three sheaths, called ghanodadhivātavalaya, ghanavātavalaya, and tanuvātavalaya. All these are surrounded by the infinite non-universe-space (alokākāśa). In spite of such security, neither the creator-minister nor the king-of-kings (cakravartī) are able to secure the human beings. In this world, death is inviolable.
