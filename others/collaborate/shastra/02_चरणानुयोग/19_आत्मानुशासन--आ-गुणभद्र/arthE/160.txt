O soul! Your natural attribute of knowledge that encompasses objects of the three worlds has been destroyed by karma, and your natural bliss that is independent of all external objects has also been destroyed completely by karma. For long you have observed self-imposed inflictions like fasting and partaking of only the unsavoury food. Now, without shame, you are feeling satisfied with the lowly sensepleasures provided by karma.
