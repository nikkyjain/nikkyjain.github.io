Why would the ascetics who know all substances worth accepting and rejecting, are completely rid of sinful activity, are absorbed in self-contemplation after calming down the fidgetiness of the senses, who speak only what is beneficial to the self and the others, and are rid of all volitions (sa√âkalpa) and inquisitiveness (vikalpa), not merit liberation?
