O soul! Floating in the river of desires, in a state of dependence, you have gone very far astray. Are you not aware that, in reality, you are quite capable of crossing this river of desires? Hence, experience independence (from desires) so that you soon reach the shore of this river. If you do not exert soon, floating in the current of this river of desires, you are bound to enter the ocean of worldly existence that is more terrible than the deep and wide-open mouth of the crocodile of death.
