The Jaina literature – prathamānuyoga – is replete with stories of great men of the past who had truthfulness in speech, the Scripture in intellect, compassion in heart, heroism in arms, strength of LakÈmī, wholesome charity for the suppliant, and treading the path to liberation. Even such great men were free from pride. It is a pity that in the present time men without a trace of such virtues are seen to be overtly overbearing.
