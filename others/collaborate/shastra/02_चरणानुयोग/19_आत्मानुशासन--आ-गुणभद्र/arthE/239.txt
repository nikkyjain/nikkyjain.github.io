Auspicious (śubha) and inauspicious (aśubha), merit (puõya) and demerit (pāpa), and happiness (sukha) and misery (duÍkha) – these are six. The first of each of these three pairs – auspicious (śubha), merit (puõya), and happiness (sukha) – are beneficial for the soul and worth accepting. The remaining three – inauspicious (aśubha), emerit (pāpa), and misery (duÍkha) – are harmful for the soul and worth rejecting.
