In this kali age (the fifth period, called duÈamā), justice is by punishment, and punishment is awarded by the kings. The kings use it to extract money but the woods-living ascetics have no money. (Therefore, the kings have no interest in controlling the conduct of the ascetics.) Now, the preceptors (ācārya), due to their fondness for obeisance, fail to put their follower-ascetics on the right path. In such a situation, among ascetics, those who observe right conduct, as prescribed, are extremely rare, like glittering gems.
