O worthy soul! For you, who has destroyed the external enemy in form of excessive sinful activity and increased the internal soul-strength, there can be no remaining cause of misery. Desirous of extirpating your internal enemies (of attachment and aversion), continue safeguarding your austerities by being vigilant in activities of eating, sleeping, roaming and sitting.
