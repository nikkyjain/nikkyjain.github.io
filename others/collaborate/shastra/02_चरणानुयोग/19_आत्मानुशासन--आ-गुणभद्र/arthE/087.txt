The dreadful ocean of worldly existence is full of brackish water, incapable of quenching thirst, in form of pleasures that charming objects provide. As the ocean burns from inside due to the flames of the oceanic-fire, the worldly existence burns due to the fire of various kinds of mental agony. It is unsteady due to the waves of death, birth and old-age. It is full of cruel water-animals, like the crocodile of delusion, with gaping mouths; it is rare to find men who can keep themselves away from these gaping
mouths.
