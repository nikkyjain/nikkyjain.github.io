If the preceptor (guru), in order not to disturb the strength of his order or due to ignorance, covers upcertain faults of the disciple, and if the disciple dies with those faults, what then can he (the preceptor) do? He fails to do good to his disciple. The disciple, therefore, reckons that the preceptor who covers up his faults is not the true preceptor. He feels that the wicked preceptor, who keeps a constant and sharp eye even on his minor faults and proclaims these with exaggeration, is his true preceptor (guru).
