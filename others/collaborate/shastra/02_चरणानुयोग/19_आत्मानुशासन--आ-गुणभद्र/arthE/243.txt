Mistaking the self (the soul) for the body (the others) and the body (the others) for the self (the soul), this soul has been wandering in the world. ‘Certainly, I am not others, I am not the body, etc.; I am only I. And, the others (the body) are others only; others are not I.’ When this true discernment dawns on the soul, it gets rid of wandering in the world.
