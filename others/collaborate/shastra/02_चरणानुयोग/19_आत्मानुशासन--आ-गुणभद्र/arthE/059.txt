O imprudent being! Know that your body is like a prisonhouse built of bones acting as thick logs of wood, fastened
by muscles and veins, covered up by skin, plastered with
the mixture of blood and wet-flesh, guarded by the enemy
in form of evil-karmas, and confined by the heavy
shackles of age (āyuÍ). Do not have foolish fondness for
this prison-house.
