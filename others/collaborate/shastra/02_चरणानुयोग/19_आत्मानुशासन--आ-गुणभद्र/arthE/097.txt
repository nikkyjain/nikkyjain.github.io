The body is impure all over, and the cause of many miseries. Still, the man living in such a body does not become averse to it. On the other hand, he becomes greatly attached to it. The saints, who wish only his wellbeing, try to engender in him through excellent discourses a sense of detachment for the impure body. The fondness of such high-minded persons for the wellbeing of others is laudable.
