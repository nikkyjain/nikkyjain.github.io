The one who has the wisdom about the reality of substances, has assimilated the core of the Scripture, knows the ways of the world, has no desire for worldly riches and honour, has sharp intellect, is serene, has sharp wit to know beforehand the answers to all future questions, has the ability to face with calmness almost all kinds of questions, enjoys lordship over the audience, is attractive, and is a repository of good qualities; such leader of the congregation should deliver his discourse in clear and sweet words, without speaking ill of others.
