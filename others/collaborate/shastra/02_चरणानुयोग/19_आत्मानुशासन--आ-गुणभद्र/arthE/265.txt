The soul – the possessor-of-quality (guõavān) – is inseparable from the quality (guõa). Hence, destruction of the quality (guõa) would mean destruction of the possessor-of-quality (guõavān). While the doctrines of the others have imagined liberation (of the soul) as absolute non-existence (śūnya), the Jaina Doctrine has expounded liberation as absolute absence of auspicious (śubha) and inauspicious (aśubha) dispositions due to attachment (rāga) and aversion (dveÈa) in the soul.
