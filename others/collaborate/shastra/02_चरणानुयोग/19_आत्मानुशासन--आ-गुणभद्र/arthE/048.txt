O worthy soul! Ignorant of the true nature of substances you have classified these as either desirable or undesirable. Why do you waste your time, over and over, by getting attached to external objects (the wife, the son, wealth)? Before you get reduced to ashes on getting burnt by the glittering flames of cruel and copious fire of death, attain internal happiness that is marked by freedom from attachment (rāga) and aversion (dveÈa).
