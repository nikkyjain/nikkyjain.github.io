The ‘pure-soul’ (paramātmā), the Lord of the three worlds, is worthy of adoration through meditation. Noble men take delight in such meditation. If at all such meditation involves any trouble, it is concentrating the mind on the Lotus Feet of the Lord. If at all it involves any loss, it is the loss of the evil karmas. The bliss of liberation is its fruit. How much time does it take? Not much; just an ‘antarmuhūrta’ (within 48 minutes). The control of the mind is its method. O wise men! Concentrate, therefore, on the ‘pure-soul’ (paramātmā) in a proper manner; what hardship does it entail?
