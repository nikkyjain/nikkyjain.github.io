O worthy soul! When you have become delusion-free in respect of attractive external objects – inanimate and animate (the wife, the son, etc.) – why do you then unnecessarily delude yourself in respect of your instruments of restraint, the feather-whisk (picchī) and the water-pot (kamaõdalu)? Does any wise man, who takes no food for fear of disease, ever provoke indigestion by intake of (too much) medicine?
