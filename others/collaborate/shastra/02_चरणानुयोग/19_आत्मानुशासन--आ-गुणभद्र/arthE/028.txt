O worthy soul! Evil-passions (vyasana), like hunting, are evidently abodes of misery; only the sinners indulge in these, and, being the cause of misery in future lives, these are excessively frightful. Even these, just by mentalresolve (imagination), may appear to be your sources of enjoyment. Men of discrimination engage, without leaving sensual enjoyment, in laudable conduct that brings propitiousness in this world and the next. Why should you not take a mental-resolve to adopt such laudable conduct? (You should imagine that happiness resides only in laudable conduct.)
