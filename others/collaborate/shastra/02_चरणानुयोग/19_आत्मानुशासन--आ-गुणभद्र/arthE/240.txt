Out of the three – auspicious (śubha), merit (puõya), and happiness (sukha) – mentioned above as beneficial for the soul, discard the first one. By doing this, the remaining two will automatically cease to exist. Thus leaving the auspicious (śubha), the soul gets established in its pure (śuddha) nature, and reaches ultimately the supreme state of liberation.
