The rise and fall (of life, body, wealth, etc.) due to karmas that have earned merit (puõya) and demerit (pāpa) in the past life are common to all living beings. However, the one who attends to the rise and fall responsible for attainment of the excellent state of existence is called wise. On the contrary, the one who attends to the rise and fall responsible for attainment of the wretched state of existence is called a fool.
