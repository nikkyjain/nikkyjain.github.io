The age (āyuÍ) is getting consumed incessantly like the emptying of the buckets in a water-wheel (used to hoist water) and this wicked body too is treading the same steps (of age). Then, what can the living being gain through the wife, the sons and the friends who are clearly distinct from the Self? Here, in this world, the living being is alive till he has these two (age and body). Still,the ignorant sees his life as enduring, as the person sailing in the boat sees himself as non-moving.
