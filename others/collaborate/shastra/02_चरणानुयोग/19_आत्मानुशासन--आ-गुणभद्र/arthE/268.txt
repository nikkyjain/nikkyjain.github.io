This way, using a few words, this useful work (for performance of the four adorations*) has been composed. This will be enchanting to the hearts of the men with noble thoughts. May the potential-souls (bhavya), who ponder this composition continuously and wholly, soon get rid of all adversities and attain the LakÈmī of liberation!
