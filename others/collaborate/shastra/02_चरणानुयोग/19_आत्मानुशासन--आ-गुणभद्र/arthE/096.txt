The verse has two meanings.
The first is the literal meaning:
a) The mountains are covered with tall bamboo trees;their expanse can only be imagined; their wealth is the height; the space that these mountains adorn with their beauty is the excellent space. Serpents on its long route make it extremely difficult to tread the path. Its directions cannot be well-specified. It is, therefore, inappropriate for the great men to describe it. But that has been seen directly by the second minister, named Sarvārya.

The second is the inferred meaning:
b) The word ‘pradeśa’ in the verse implies ‘dharma’. By following dharma, men are born in monarchical families like IkÈvāku; they attain great wisdom, and acquire immense virtues and prosperity. Other men, desirous of wealth, bow their heads in front of such rulers of men. Dharma is the most excellent possession. The path of dharma consists in following conduct of many kinds, including giving of gifts and self-restraint. It is free from desires and, as such, those with voluptuous inclinations cannot access it. It cannot be expounded clearly by even eminent personages. This dharma was seen directly bySarvārya (read sarvajña) – the one who is worshipped by all – or, the Omniscient Lord.
