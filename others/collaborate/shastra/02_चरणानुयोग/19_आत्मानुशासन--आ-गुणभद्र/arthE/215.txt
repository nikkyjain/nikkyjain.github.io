O worthy soul! You have embarked on austerities (tapa), greatly subdued the passions (kaÈāya), and deep knowledge, like waters of the ocean, has manifested in you. Still, subdued by karmas, you carry invincible jealousy, invisible to others, for your fellow-ascetics; it is like the invisible flow of water deep in the seemingly placid ocean. Get rid of this jealousy.
