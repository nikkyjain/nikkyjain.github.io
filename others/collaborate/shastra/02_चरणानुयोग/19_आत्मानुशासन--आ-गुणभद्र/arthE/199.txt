O worthy soul! Having been associated with this body, you have accepted this distressful woman. While doing so, having left grace and self-respect, you do not count the hundreds of humiliations due to her. Further, not being able to acquire austerities and self-restraint meant for soul-development, you have lost the happiness of liberation; you do not count this too. These, the body and the woman, are certainly not going to walk with you even one step; you will again be deceived. Therefore, O ascetic, if you are wise, leave friendship with this body; leave infatuation for this body.
