A substance, at any time, exhibits contradictory attributes of affirmation (tat, vidhi – existence) as well as of negation (atat, niÈedha – non-existence), depending on the point-of-view. All substances, thus, are eternal. This way, the man, well-versed in the Scripture, should reflect on the world that is without a beginning and an end.
