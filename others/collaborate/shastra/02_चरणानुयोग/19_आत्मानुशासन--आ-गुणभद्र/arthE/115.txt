The body of the ascetic vanishes when, in time, it has produced the excellent fruit of merit (puõya) on the creeper of austerity (tapa); it is like the flower that vanishes, in time and on its own, from the top of the unripe fruit. His age (āyuÍ) dries up safeguarding his asceticism including the virtuous (dharmya) and the pure (śukla) meditation; it is like the water that dries up safeguarding the milk from the fire. Blessed is such an ascetic.
