The asceticism is like a house. This house is protected by strong doors in form of ‘gupti’ – curbing of activities of the mind, the speech and the body. Its walls are ‘dhairya’ – firmness. Its foundation is ‘buddhi’ – the knowledge or the intellect. This house of asceticism is damaged by the snakes of attachment (rāga) and aversion (dveÈa) if even a small hole (of wrong-conduct) is left in it.
