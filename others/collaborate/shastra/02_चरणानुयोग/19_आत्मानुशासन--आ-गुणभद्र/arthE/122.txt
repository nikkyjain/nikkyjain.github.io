Such accomplished, worthy soul, due to the effect of the scriptural knowledge, moves from the stage of disposition that is inauspicious (aśubha, marked by asaÉyama) to auspicious (śubha, marked by saÉyama) and finally, void of all karmic dirt, to pure (śuddha). It is right; as there is no trace of darkness in the sun till dusk, the ascetic who has reached the pure (śuddha) stage, has no trace of inauspicious or even auspicious dispositions.
