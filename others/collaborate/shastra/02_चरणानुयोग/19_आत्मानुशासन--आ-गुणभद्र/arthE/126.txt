People call certain kinds of cobras that eject venom into the eyes of the onlooker, ‘dÃÈÇiviÈa’; this is not appropriate. Such ‘dÃÈÇiviÈa’ is clearly seen in women whose seductive half-glances burn down the victim (the worldly man) from all sides. O ascetic! As you have turned away from them, you have made them extremely angry and they are roaming near you. They are just venom in form of women; do not fall prey to them.
