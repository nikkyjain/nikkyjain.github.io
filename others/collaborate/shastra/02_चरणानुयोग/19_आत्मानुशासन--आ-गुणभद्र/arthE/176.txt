As the jewel gets purified and resplendent on entering the fire, the potential (bhavya) soul, on entering the fire of the Scripture, gets purified and attains resplendent liberation. The wicked [non-potential (abhavya)] soul, however, on entering the fire of the Scripture, gets scorched, turns dark like coal, and is reduced to ashes.
