In the childhood, when the body is not fully developed, the man is ignorant of what is favourable and what is unfavourable. In the young-age, blinded by sex-desire, he roams around in the forest populated densely with trees that are young women; here also he is ignorant of what is favourable and what is unfavourable. In the middle-age, to pacify increased cravings, he troubles himself earning money through occupations like farming and commerce; here too he is ignorant of what is favourable and what is unfavourable. In the old-age, his body becomes flaccid, like the half-dead; here again he is ignorant of what is favourable and what is unfavourable. In such a situation, O worthy soul, when will you adopt right conduct that will make success of your life?
