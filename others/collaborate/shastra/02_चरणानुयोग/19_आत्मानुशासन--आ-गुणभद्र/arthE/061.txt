O embodied being! Why worry about wealth that acts as
fuel for the fire of your cravings? Why worry about family
and other relations who constantly push you into
wickedness. What is the use of the body or the home
which are like the deep holes of the serpent of delusion
(moha)? For happiness, therefore, calm down your
cravings; no use being lax.
