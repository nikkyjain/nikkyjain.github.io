‘In the whirl of transmigration, earlier, I have never contemplated on observances, like right faith (samyagdarśana). Now I contemplate on such observances. I have contemplated, over and over again, on observances, like wrong faith (mithyādarśana). Now I stop contemplation on such observances. Leaving observances that I contemplated on earlier, I now contemplate on new observances that cause the destruction of mundane existence.’
