The fame of Mārīca got tarnished by his deceitfulness of taking on the garb of a golden deer. YudhiÈÇhira’s* esteem was lowered among his dear ones due to his deceitful utterance, “Aśvatthāmā is killed.” And, KÃÈõa’s reputation was blackened (he was born with dark complexion!) due to his deceitful role in the dwarfish vāmana incarnation. It is right; even a little deceitfulness is devastating, as a little poison added to a large quantity of milk.
