The day which is seen by a man as ‘tomorrow’, becomes
‘yesterday’ for him. Nothing is permanent here; this
world is being blown incessantly by the wind of ‘time’
(kāla). O brother! Why don’t you give up illusion, and see
what is visible directly to your eyes? Like a slave of
desires, you repeatedly long for external, transient
objects and have consequently been wandering in this
world from a very long time.
