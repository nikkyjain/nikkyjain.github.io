When right faith (samyagdarśana) arises on listening to the discourse on rules of conduct for the ascetics as detailed in the caranānuyoga, it is called the glorious sūtrasamudbhava. It is difficult to attain knowledge of the nature of substances of reality or of subjects like mathematics. When, on extraordinary subsidence (upaśama) of perception-delusion (darśanamoha), right faith (samyagdarśana) arises in some potential soul on acquisition of knowledge of the above mentioned subjects through incantation of the first-letter (bījakÈara) of a mantra, it is called bījasamudbhava. When right faith (samyagdarśana) arises in a potential soul through acquisition of only brief knowledge about the nature of substances, it is called saÉkÈepasamudbhava.
