O worthy soul! Your folly makes you abandon right faith (samyagdarśana), etc., which are beneficial, and accept wrong faith (mithyādarśana), etc., which are harmful; you are, thus, making yourself miserable. Be discerning and do the opposite; abandon the harmful wrong faith, etc., and accept the beneficial right faith, etc. You will make yourself happy.
