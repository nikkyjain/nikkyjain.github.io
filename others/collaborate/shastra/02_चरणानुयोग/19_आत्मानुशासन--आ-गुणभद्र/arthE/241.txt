The soul does exist and, since beginningless time, it is in (karmic) bondage. Bondage is caused by influx (āsrava) of the karmic matter, auspicious and inauspicious, due to the activities of the mind, the speech, and the body. Influx (āsrava) is caused by passions (kaÈāya), like anger (krodha). Passions, like anger, are caused by negligence (pramāda). Negligence is caused by vowlessness (avirati) which results from wrong-belief. The same soul in (karmic) bondage, in a particular mode (paryāya) and on attainment of a favourable-time (kālalabdhi), observes these – right faith (samyagdarśana), vows (vrata), nonnegligence (apramāda), destruction of passions (kaÈāya), and curbing of activity (yoga) – sequentially, and finally gets liberated.
