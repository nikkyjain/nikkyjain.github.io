As long as cruel water-animals, in form of cluster of passions (kaÈāya), exist in your pristine and unfathomable lake of the heart (the mind), certainly, fearless existence of cluster of virtues, in form of forbearance, etc., is not possible. Therefore, O worthy soul! With observance of vows (yama) and tranquility (śama), strive to subjugate those passions.
