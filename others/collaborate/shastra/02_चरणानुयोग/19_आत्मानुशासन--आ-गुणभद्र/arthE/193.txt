O soul! For very long, by adopting conduct that destroys the soul-nature, you have lived as a vicious-soul (an extroverted-soul – bahirātmā). Now, by adopting such conduct that benefits the soul you become a righteoussoul (an introverted-soul – antarātmā). You can then reach the stage of the pure-soul (paramātmā), which can only be attained through self-effort. In this stage, the soul becomes of the nature of infinite-knowledge (omniscience), and enjoyer of the soul-bliss that is independent of all external sense-objects. Such is the resplendent own-nature of the soul, realized by the soul itself.
