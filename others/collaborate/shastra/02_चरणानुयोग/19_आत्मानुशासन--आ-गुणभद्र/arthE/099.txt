During the course of pregnancy, the living being, swayed by karmas, lives in the womb of the mother, the seat of excrement. Inflicted by hunger and thirst, and with increased craving, he awaits, with open mouth, the remnant food that has been eaten by the mother. In tight space, he is unable to move his body parts, has to live with bodily worms, and remains ever afraid of the pain in being born. O the one, born! You are afraid of death. It appears to me that since you have already experienced the pain in being born, and since you know that death entails new birth, therefore, you are afraid of death.
