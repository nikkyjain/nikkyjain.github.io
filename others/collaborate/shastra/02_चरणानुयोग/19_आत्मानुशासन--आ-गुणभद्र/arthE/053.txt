Just the recollection of the worldly existence causes
extreme anguish; no point in discussing the sufferings
you have experienced (in the past) in worldly states of
existence, like the infernal being. O worthy soul! But
then you bear in mind the suffering, like ‘burning’ of a
young sapling bitten by frost, when here, as a pauper, you
were attacked by the arrows of Cupid in form of
voluptuous smiles and piercing glances of women.
