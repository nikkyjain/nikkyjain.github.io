What happiness can the men, swayed by the strong wind of (craving for) wealth, attain? This implies that the happiness attained through austerity (tapa) can never be attained by those craving for wealth. Can the evil hunter in form of carnal lust harm the man fortified by austerity? Further, can the dust of disgrace ever touch even the feet of the man fortified by austerity? O worthy souls! Tell me if there is a better means than austerity for attaining the desired goal of liberation.
