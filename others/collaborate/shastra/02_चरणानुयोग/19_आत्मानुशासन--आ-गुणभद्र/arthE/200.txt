The possessor-of-attribute (guõī, dravya) does not become one with another possessor-of-attribute. But (incorporeal) you, due to karma, are getting one with this corporeal body. Certainly, the body, etc., that you consider one with you, are not your nature. Due to this infatuation for the body you are facing excessive miseries, being cut and pierced, in this forest of worldly existence.
