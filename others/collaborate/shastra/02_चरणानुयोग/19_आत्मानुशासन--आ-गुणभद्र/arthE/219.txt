The earth (universe) that supports all objects is supported by others (the three sheaths)*. These, the earth and the sheaths, are stationed in the middle of the space (ākāśa). The space, too, is obscure in one corner of the knowledge of the Omniscient. In such a situation, when someone else with greater qualities exists, how can one entertain the sense of pride?
