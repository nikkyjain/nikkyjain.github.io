The ignorant men are not able to discriminate between the desire (mental inclination) and the soul. However, the supreme ascetics whose intellect does not rest till it is able to discern between these two, and, possessed of wealth of tranquility, vanquish all external volitions by being established in their soul-nature. May the sacred dust raised by their feet purify us!
