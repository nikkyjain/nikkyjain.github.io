The stage of the householder for even those rich in wisdom, in general, results in these kinds of conduct: full of merit (when engaged in auspicious activity like meditation on the Self), full of demerit (when engaged in enjoyment of sense-pleasures), and part merit and part demerit (when engaged in activities like building of a temple). It is like the making of a rope by the blind (as he twists one end of the rope, the other end gets undone), or the bathing of an elephant (no sooner had it sprinkled the water, than it put mud on the body), or the actions of the inebriated man (being without discrimination, his actions are not praiseworthy). This stage of the householder is not wholly beneficial.
