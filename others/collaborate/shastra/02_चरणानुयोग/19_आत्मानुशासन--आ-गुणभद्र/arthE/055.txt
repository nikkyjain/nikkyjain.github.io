Anguished, as if by the scorching and blinding rays of the
unrelenting summer sun, by the senses, and athirst for
sense-pleasures, the man loses his sense of
discrimination. As he gets anguished seeking the desired
pleasures, he engages himself in sinful activities. His
anguish on not getting hold of the desired pleasures is
akin to the anguish of the powerless ox who, thirsty for
water, gets entrapped in the deep mire at the edge of a
piece of water.
