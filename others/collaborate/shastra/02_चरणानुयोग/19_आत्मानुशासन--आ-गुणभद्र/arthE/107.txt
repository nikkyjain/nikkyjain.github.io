O worthy soul! With a clear mind, make efforts to tread the path that is marked by compassion (dayā or ahiÉsā), self-restraint (indriyadamana or saÉyama), renunciation (dāna or parigrahatyāga), and meditation (samādhi or dhyāna). This path certainly leads to that excellent state of liberation (mokÈa) which is beyond words and rid of all inquisitiveness (vikalpa).
