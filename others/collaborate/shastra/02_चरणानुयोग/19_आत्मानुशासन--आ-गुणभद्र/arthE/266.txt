The soul, from the point-of-view of the substance – dravyārthika naya – is eternal, free from birth and death. From the point-of-view of its pure own-nature (svabhāva), it is incorporeal and does not have the qualities of colour, taste, smell and touch. From the empirical (vyavahāra) point-of-view, it is the doer of auspicious (śubha) and inauspicious (aśubha) karmas, but from the (impure) transcendental point-of-view (aśuddha niścaya naya) it is the doer of its psychic dispositions. From the empirical (vyavahāra) point-of-view, it is the enjoyer of happiness (sukha) or misery (duÍkha) as the fruits of its previously bound karmas, but from the real, transcendental point-of-view (niścaya naya) it enjoys infinite bliss. Happiness and knowledge are its ownnature (svabhāva). Empirically, it is of the size of the body, small or big. But, from the real point-of-view, it has innumerable space-points (pradeśa), equal to the universe-space (lokākāśa). When rid of all karmic dirt, it naturally moves upward till the top of the universe, and remains steady forever atop the ‘Siddha śilā’.
