O worthy souls! All those you consider as your refuge are
not so. Your kinsmen, which engender attachment and
aversion, are the cause of bondage of karmas. Your wife,
whom you have known for long, is the door to the abodes
of adversity. Know your sons too to be your enemies.
Reflecting in this manner, forsake them all and, as you
desire happiness, engage in adoration of the pristine
dharma.
