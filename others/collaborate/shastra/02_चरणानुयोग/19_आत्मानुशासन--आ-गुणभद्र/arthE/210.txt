The worldly souls have three components: the first component is the seven-elementary-constituents (alimentary juice, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow and semen), the second component is karmas like the knowledge-obscuring (jñānāvaraõīya)*, and the third component is the soul’s own-nature of knowledge, etc.
