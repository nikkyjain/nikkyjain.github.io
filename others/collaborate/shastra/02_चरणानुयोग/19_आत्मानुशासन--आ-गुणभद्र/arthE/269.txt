The ascetics are like the army of Lord Jina, the destroyer of karma-enemies. The apostles (gaõadhara) are the preceptors of the ascetics. Remembering always their pious feet, the worshipful ācārya(s), themselves possessing many propitious qualities, have crafted this composition that expounds the nature of the soul.
Alternate meaning: This composition – 'Ātmānuśāsana' – is the work of Ācārya Gunbhadra whose heart is dedicated to the remembrance of the feet of his Preceptor, Ācārya Jinasena.
