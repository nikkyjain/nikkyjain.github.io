Those who consider themselves ascetics, when bitten by the half-glances of women, roam around in distress; like deer with their bodies pierced by arrows. It is a pity that, in midst of the forest of desires, they are not able to rest themselves anywhere. O worthy soul! Do not get into the company of such unpredictable ascetics who are fickle like the clouds beaten by winds.
