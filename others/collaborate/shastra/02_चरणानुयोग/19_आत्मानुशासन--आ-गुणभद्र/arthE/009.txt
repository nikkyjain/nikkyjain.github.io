All living beings wish for early attainment of real happiness; real happiness arises on destruction of all karmas; destruction of karmas is caused by observing right conduct; right conduct ensues from right knowledge; right knowledge is obtained from the Scripture (āgama); the Scripture comprises the discourse on the twelve-departments (dvādaśāńga, jinavāõī); the discourse on the twelve-departments emanates from the Omniscient Lord (Āpta); the Omniscient Lord is completely rid of (the eighteen) imperfections (see p. 4, ante); the imperfections are nothing but faults such as attachment (rāga). Therefore, the worthy seeker of real happiness must, after due discernment, take refuge in the Omniscient Lord (Āpta), the source of all that is beneficial.
