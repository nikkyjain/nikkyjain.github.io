The extremely mighty Indra, who had BÃhaspati* as his advisor, thunderbolt as his weapon, celestial beings as his army, heaven as his fortress, Airāvata as his elephant, and Hari as his benefactor, lost battle against the demons (read Rāvaõa). It is clear, therefore, that own-fate (daiva) is the only protection; self-effort (puruÈārtha) is futile and contemptible.
