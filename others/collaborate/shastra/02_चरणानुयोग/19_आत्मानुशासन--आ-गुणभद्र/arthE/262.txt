Karmas of merit (puõya) and demerit (pāpa) accumulated over the past life are termed own-fate – ‘daiva’. While experiencing happiness and misery due to own-fate or ‘daiva’, the wise man who engages only in auspicious (śubha) activities, leaving all inauspicious (aśubha) activities, is admirable. But the discriminating soul which, with the idea of destroying both merit (puõya) and demerit (pāpa) and leaving behind the demon of worldly occupations and possessions, gets established in purecognition (śuddhopayoga) is worthy of adoration by noble men.
