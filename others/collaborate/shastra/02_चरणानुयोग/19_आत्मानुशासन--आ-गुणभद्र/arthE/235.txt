The whole world is essentially one; segregation of its objects in terms of agreeable and disagreeable is just in the mind. Mental association (pravÃtti) for an object makes it agreeable, and dissociation (nivÃtti) disagreeable. The worthy soul who desires liberation should practise withdrawal from mental segregation of objects in terms of agreeable and disagreeable. (see also verse 180, p. 148, ante)
