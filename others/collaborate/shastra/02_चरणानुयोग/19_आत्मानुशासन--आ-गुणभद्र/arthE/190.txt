O worthy soul! In this world, you study the Scripture incessantly, without desire for renown and without pretense. Also, dry up your body through well-known austerities (tapa) like endurance of bodily discomfiture so as to vanquish intractable enemies of passions (kaÈāya) and sense-pleasures (viÈaya). It is so because learned ascetics consider the suppression of attachment and aversion the only fruit of austerities and the study of the Scripture.
