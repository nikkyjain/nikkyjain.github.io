When the man becomes indifferent to the fruits, in form of happiness and misery, of the past karmas, he neither relishes nor detests these fruits. As he becomes rid of attachment (rāga) and aversion (dveÈa), his past karmas fall off and fresh karmas do not bind him. Equipped thus with stoppage (saÉvara) and dissociation (nirjarā) of karmas, he shines forth like a pristine jewel; he is adorned with perfect-knowledge – omniscience (kevalajñāna) – that illumines the self and the others.
