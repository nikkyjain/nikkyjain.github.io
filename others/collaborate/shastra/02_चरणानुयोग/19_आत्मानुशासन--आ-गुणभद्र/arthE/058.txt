O living being! In this world, characterized by births and
deaths, you are identified by the body that you adopt,
meaning thereby that you are always subservient to the
body that you adopt, one after the other. Under the dark
spell of sinful karmas, you experience misery at all times.
Your occupation is bondage of karmas, like the
knowledge-obscuring (jñānāvaraõīya), every instant and
of your own accord; your only rest is when you go to
sleep; you are always afraid of death but, surely, it is
inevitable. The wonder is that you still get engrossed in
this appalling world.
