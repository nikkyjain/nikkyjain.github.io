What more is there to lose for those (ascetics) who have become slaves to the lord of sense-pleasures, whose soul is dependent (on others), and whose minds cannot discern between the virtue and the evil? They have nothing to lose. But, O ascetic! Since you possess the three jewels (samyagdarśana, samyagjñāna and samyakcāritra) that illumine the world, you need to be fearful. Robbers in form of the senses are roaming all around you. Remain awake, always.
