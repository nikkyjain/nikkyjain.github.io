One wise man, considering the sense-pleasures worthless as blades of grass, gives his wealth to those who solicit it; another discerning man, considering the same wealth as the cause of evil and of anxiety, does not give it to others but leaves it as it is. The third, with excellent discrimination, perceives wealth as unfavourable and does not accrue it in the first place. These three exhibit successively higher levels of renunciation.
