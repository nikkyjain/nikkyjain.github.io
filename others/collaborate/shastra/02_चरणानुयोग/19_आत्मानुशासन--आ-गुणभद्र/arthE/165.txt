The happiness obtained as fruit of austerities (tapa) is unparalleled (beyond worldly souls), self-dependent (generated by the soul itself, with no role of karma), and eternal. There is no wonder if the king-of-kings (cakravartÄ«) leaves his kingdom for the sake of austerities (tapa). The great wonder, however, is when the wise man who had earlier renounced, like deadly poison, the sensepleasures, later on, leaves great austerities to indulge again in those sense-pleasures.
