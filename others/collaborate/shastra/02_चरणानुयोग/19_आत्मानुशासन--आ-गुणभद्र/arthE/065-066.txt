The poor are unhappy due to lack of wealth and the rich are unhappy due to discontentment. Alas! Everybody is unhappy. Only the contented ascetic is happy.
The happiness of the rich is dependent (on external objects). The self-imposed or self-dependent unhappiness (due to fasting, etc.) is better than the happiness which is dependent. Had this not been true, who would call the ascetics who observe austerities ‘happy’?
