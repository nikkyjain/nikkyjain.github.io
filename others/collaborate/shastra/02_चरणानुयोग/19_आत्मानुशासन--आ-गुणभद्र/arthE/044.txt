In search of water in his vicinity, the thirsty man began by digging the earth. He struck a rock. Continuing his quest, he dug till he reached the under-world (pātāla). With great difficulty, he got only a little brackish water that was stinking and full of worms. That too dried up quickly as he thought of drinking it. The ways of karmas (read fate or daiva) are truly amazing!
