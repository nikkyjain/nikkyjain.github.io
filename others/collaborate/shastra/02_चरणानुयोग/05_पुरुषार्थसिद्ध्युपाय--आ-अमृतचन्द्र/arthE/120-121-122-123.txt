 If this be so, there would be no difference between a cat and a young deer. No, it is not so, there is a difference as to the degree of attachinent. Attachment is weak in the young deer who lives on green blades of grass; it is strong in the cat which destroys a host of mice. The effect is certainly influenced by the cause, like the difference in desire for sweetness in milk or sugar. In the case of one who likes milk, which is moderately sweet, the desire for sweetness, is feeble. That desire is said to be intense in the case of one who likes sugar, which is extremely sweet.
