 He should pass the day, wrapped in spiritual contemplation; perform Samayika at sunset, vanquish sleep by self-study, and thus pass the night on a pure mat. He should rise in the morning, perform the necessary duties of the time, and engage in worship of Jina, as pres. cribed, with Prasuk objects, (which have no living germs in them). The day, the second night, and the half of the third day should carefully be passed in the manner stated above.
