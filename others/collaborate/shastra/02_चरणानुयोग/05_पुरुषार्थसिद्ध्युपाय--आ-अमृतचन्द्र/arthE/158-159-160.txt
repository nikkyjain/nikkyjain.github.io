On account of Bhoga and Upabhoga, Himsa of immobile beings only is caused. By renunciation of Bhoga and Upabhoga, not the slightest Himsa is occasioned, There is no falsehood, because of the control of speech ; there is no stealing, because of the abstinence from all appropriation there is no incontinence (Abrahma), because of abstinence from all sexual intercourse. There is no attachment (Parigraha), because of the absence of the feeling of attachment even to one's body. Having thus got rid of all Himsa, he practically reaches the stage of a Mahavrati ; but he cannot attain the spiritual stage of a Saint, because of the operation of Right-Conduct-deluding Karma.
