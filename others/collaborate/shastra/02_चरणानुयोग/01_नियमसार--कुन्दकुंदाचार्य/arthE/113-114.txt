Thought-activity of observing (five) vows, (five kinds of) carefulness, character and self-control; or attentiveness to the restraint of senses, is expiation (Prasyashchitta). It should be practised constantly.
Being engaged, in the contemplation of destroying (or subsiding), etc., one's own (impure) thought-activities, anger, etc., as well as, meditation upon the attributes of one's own soul, is said to be expiation from the real point of view.
