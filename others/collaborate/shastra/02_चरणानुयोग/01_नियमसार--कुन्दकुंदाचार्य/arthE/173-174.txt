Speech arising from thought-activity, is the cause of bondage in a mundane soul;      while speech independent of thought-activity cannot cause any bondage in the allknowing (soul).
Words uttered voluntarily do cause bondage in a mundane soal; while involuntary flow of speech does not cause any bondage in an all-knowing soul.
