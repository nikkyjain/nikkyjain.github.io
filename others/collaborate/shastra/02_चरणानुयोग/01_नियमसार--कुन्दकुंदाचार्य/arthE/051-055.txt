Conviction (in things ascertained as they are) alone without (any) perverse motive (is) right belief, (Samyaka Darshana). (Knowledge) free from doubt, (Samshaya), perversity (Vinoha) and vaccilation (Vibhrama) is right knowledge (Samyak Jnina).
Conviction, from wavering (Chala), impurity (Mala), and non-steadfastness (Agarha) alone (is) right belief. Correct understanding (Adhigama) of what principles are worth renouncing and what are worth realising, (is) right knowledge.
The external causes of right belief are the Jain scriptures and the persons who know them; while the destruction, etc., of right-belief-deluding Karma are said to be the internal causes.
Listen, (just as) Right Belief and Right knowledge are the causes of) liberation, (so) is Right Conduct. Therefore I shall describe Right Conduct from (both) the real and the practical points of view.
Right conduct from the practical point of view, is to practise austerities from the practical stand-point, while Right Conduct from the real point of view is to observe austerities from the real stand-point.
