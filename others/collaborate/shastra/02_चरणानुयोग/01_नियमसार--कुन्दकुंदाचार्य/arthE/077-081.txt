I am neither in any of the Soul quests, nor I am in any of the Spiritual stages, nor do I belong to any of the soul classes.
I am neither hellish, nor sub-human, nor human, nor am I in the celestial condition79.I am neither a child, nor young, nor old, nor the cause of any of them
I am neither attachment, nor aversion, nor delu. sion, nor the cause of any of them.
I am neither anger, nor pride, nor deceit, nor greed.
